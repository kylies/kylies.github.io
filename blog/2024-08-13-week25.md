When I added this theme to my list, I didn’t realise it was going to coincide with the olympics. Thought there would be some good photography of bodies in motion with gymnasts as a theme. I hadn’t meant to be so narrow but ended up only using references of people on the bars. Then when I got deeper into it I thought there would be some more unique poses, but people seem to love the shot of a person looking long.

## Day 1 - Drawing from imagination

When I started the week I thought I’d find more references where people would be simply hanging from the bar. Maybe warming up? Well I saw none.

## Day 2 - Figure sketching

Lot of C curves going on.

## Day 3 - Reference studies

Days 3 and 4 become basically the same thing on anatomy days now. Trying to think up a different kind of challenge for day 4 other than continuing regular reference studies.

## Day 4 - Style studies

As usual, there wasn’t much to find style wise for gymnasts. So I treated it as another reference study, with some added difficulty of the up angled shot. Struggled with that one a lot, trying to understand where the legs and body were hiding.

## Day 5 - Drawing from imagination

Since I found the photography fairly limited angle wise, I’m trying to push myself on drawing from imagination on anatomy weeks. So I’m trying out some “rotate shapes in your head” kind of exercise here. Well in one of my attempts, the overhead, downwards angle. I feel like it turned out even, aside from losing track of what the centre body is doing. The other 2 were more straightforward attempts to practise basic proportions.

## Elden Ring final

I forgot that I didn’t share the final version of my Elden Ring / Honeymoon piece. It’s probably my favourite piece of the year. I see it everyday on my phone screen and it still doesn’t make me cringe.

## Conclusion

I’m not sure what I’m going to work on this week. I’m torn between taking a week off from art to do some website stuff since I’ll be away from my computer next week. Or just do one final practice week before travelling next week. Also want to keep learning some Godot stuff to see if I can get a nice setup together for getting things out faster. I have a new character and world tileset to play with from [Oryx Design Lab](https://www.oryxdesignlab.com/). Already have a space with a character moving around. Next goals will be to try adding some visual effects and maybe pathing NPCs so they walk around on their own.
