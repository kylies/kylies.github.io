Towards the end of 2022 I had already started thinking of 2023 as a year I wanted to make more of an effort to get back into drawing. I missed being creative and hated watching my large collection of expensive markers slowly dry out and die.

While browsing Twitter one night I saw an artist I followed had recently published an art course on [21Draw](https://www.21-draw.com/). I'd never heard of the website before and was surprised to see that it was possibly the perfect fit for my 2023 goals. Online art lessons focused on core skills and even digital tools I was already familiar with.

I don't usually like buying something as soon as I see it but I got sucked in by the countdown clock at the top of the page promoting an End of Year Discount. 2 subscriptions for 1/3rd the price of a normal signal subscription. And I only had 5 hours left to take advantage!

So anyway, 30 minutes after finding the site I was registered and ready to go with a whole year of access.

While I was very excited to get to the courses focused on character design, Clip Studio, and Procreate, I forced myself to choose a beginner course as my first lesson. Then after the first lesson to stick to some core lessons like anatomy and perspective. So basically figure drawing all the time.

I'm now entering month two and I'm finding my time to devote to course material fading. Balancing two D&D campaigns, other hobbies, and drawing is still a struggle. But thanks to the February drawing challenged called #Funguary over on Twitter I'm still putting in some drawing time every few days. Just a little less focused then I'd like it to be. I'll talk about #Funguary in my next post.

Hoping that in March I'll have more then just a few figure drawing sketches to share.
