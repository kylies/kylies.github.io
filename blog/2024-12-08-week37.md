Possibly last anatomy week of 2024??? This week is running, which I was pretty surprised I hadn’t done yet. Even just went and skimmed my tracking sheet to double check.

## Day 1 - Drawing from imagination

Some early day 1 space misjudgements here. Chopped off the top of a head.

## Day 2 - Figure sketching

A fair bit better over day 1 I would say. It’s just so easy to mess up proportions on bodies in motion. I was also happy to find so many different angled shots on runners. Even though it did up the difficulty.

## Day 3 - Reference studies

## Day 4 - Style studies

I kind of wish I had leaned even further into anime runs for my style studies, but probably best to keep it balanced with other types of references. Anime just has lots of kinetic energy in their running animations. It’s through a lot of exaggeration which is still something I’m finding difficult to do.

## Day 5 - Drawing from imagination

Don’t love this final day, lots of mismatched angles from lower bodies to upper bodies. Couldn’t figure out the foot on the front facing one. The bird's eye view one came out okay though. And in profile feels easy enough now, but any angle beyond that becomes risky.

## Conclusion

I don’t have my last 3 weeks selected yet but I’m tempted to take up the challenge of bicycles. Which is terrifying. That or cars. Transportation objects, terrible. But also tempted to Maybe return to my very first WAP month and revisit some of my first subjects. See if any of the learning from the start of the year stuck around.
