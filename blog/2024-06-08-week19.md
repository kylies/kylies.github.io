This week's theme is chameleons, another creature I’ve always loved. But I can’t trace back my memory to any particular stand out chameleons. Not in tv, movies or books. They’ve always been weird little guys, between the colour changing, the long tongue. Maybe that’s enough to make them memorable to a kid.

## Day 5 - Drawing from imagination

I’ve been trying to jot down little notes about key traits you want to capture when drawing specific creatures. While also noticing what gets changed for cartoon versions. For chameleons almost everyone changes their tiny eyes into huge eyes. A classic cutifying move but to me it loses a key chameleon trait. For my final day I did a chameleon with regular eyes and then did a copy with the cartoon style eyes. It does change of the face drastically, making it way easier to work with expressions. But I still don’t love it, the swivel eyes are so good and unique.

## Conclusion

This might be the week with the least amount of change form day 1 to day 5... maybe I already knew chameleon's pretty well.
