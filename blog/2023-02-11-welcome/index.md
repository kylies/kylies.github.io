Hi!

This blog is going to be used to document my Return To Art.

I used to draw regularly, then I returned to working full time and the hobby died while I was busy doing a capitalism. Trying to find a little more balance for hobbies in my life now by making a conscious effort to take courses and build habits around regular practice.

My plan is to use this blog to document my lesson homework and other art challenges I try to take on over the rest of the year.
