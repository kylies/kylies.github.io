This week is another one pulled from old childhood art, another book cover I made featuring a crying sea turtle. I loved turtles a lot when I was a kid. Franklin was my favourite toy, I had almost every book, even dressed as Franklin for Halloween once. These turtles are not Franklin turtles though, this week is sea turtles only.

## Day 1 - Drawing from imagination

Sea turtles have a nice consistent shape to them, it makes sense, way more than hyena’s at least.

## Day 2 - Figure sketching

I know there are other types of sea turtles out there but I ended up with a lot of either green sea turtles or hawksbills.

## Day 3 - Reference studies

Someday I’ll be willing to draw all the scales.

## Day 4 - Style studies

I was kind of surprised at how few stylized sea turtles I could find on Pinterest. Once again babies dominated and there was a lot of Disney influence going around.

This one was fun to find because it’s someone doing a similar exercise. Various attempts at a cartoon version of a baby turtle.

## Day 5 - Drawing from imagination

A little rougher than I was hoping. The below shot with the front fins pulled in was ambitious and kind of loses its shape.

## Conclusion

Falling behind on blog posts, at this exact moment I already have all the art pieces completed for number 19. I also just signed up for a mini character design challenge next week so I may break from the format for a week.
