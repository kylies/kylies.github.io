Action anatomy week, swimming. Some nice perspective shots but fewer variety to those shots than I expected.

## Day 1 - Drawing from imagination

It quickly became obvious that foreshortening and proportion length would be the main difficulty with these.

## Day 4 - Style studies

Reference options were pretty slim, I wasn't excited about these but once I started I appreciated the simplicity of the art. Made it easier to think about flowing lines which felt like an important feature to keep the movement looking fluid.

## Conclusion

Rushed the last few days into the week as I got hit pretty hard by a vaccine reaction. And this coming week is busy with going into the office so I may not have a WAP for next week.
