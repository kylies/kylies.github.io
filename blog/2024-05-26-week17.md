It’s time for another anatomy week. This week I went with volleyball poses. I played a lot of volleyball between the ages of ~14-18 so I’m pretty familiar with the sport, but it has been a long time since I’ve seen any volleyball in action.

## Day 1 - Drawing from imagination

I didn’t hate these sketches after doing them which is a pretty rare day 1 feeling.

## Day 2 - Figure sketching

There’s plenty of volleyball photography out there, and some really good action poses since there’s a lot of quick movements during a game.

## Day 3 - Reference studies

Each day feels like it's getting a little cleaner.

## Day 4 - Style studies

People have done some really dramatic angles in their volleyball poses. I still rarely play around with perspective, especially with the anatomy weeks since I still want to get more consistent at proportions but also foreshortening.

## Day 5 - Drawing from imagination

I didn’t push too much outside my comfort zone with this one but I did try to do an aerial angle on one. I can now see that the head is off angle but overall it feels like a small baby step to playing with perspective more.

## Conclusion

On top of my weekly practice I also did a colour study this week. A common practice method I’ve been wanting to do more is to try from movie stills. Movies are heavily invested in lighting and composition so learning from movies you like is a good way to learn.

I did direct colour picks from this still from The Fall, one of my favourite movies. The whole movie is rather muted but the characters themselves often have a very vibrant colour as part of their outfit. I really like this bright red and gold outfit in this scene of beautiful stucco structures. Next time I’ll try choosing the colours manually instead of colour picking them with the eye drop tool to see if I can guess the colours because when using the eye drop I’m often surprised by how much darker or lighter a colour is once I see it on the colour wheel.
