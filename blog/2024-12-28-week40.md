WAP 40, the final WAP of 2024!

This is another week of revisiting animal subjects of the last year. I even tried to embrace slightly more cartoony looks for them. Really kind of trying to put my brain on auto-pilot and seeing what comes out. I went and included side by sides for each day as I realized that seeing the comparison was really what I was doing these 2 weeks for.

## Day 1 - Sea turtles

## Conclusion

And that’s the end of the year of WAPs. I’m happy I did these last 2 weeks as revisits, it’s reassuring that some of the things I learned from those weeks seem to have stuck around. It’s been an interesting year and I’m pretty proud of sticking with it. Even ended up blogging every week’s efforts which I hadn’t planned on being able to do, it didn’t feel like something I could keep up with at the start of the year. Having spent the last 2 weeks re-reading those old posts I do regret not writing more during the exercises. It would have been nice to return to a list of key features to focus on for each creature.

I’m putting together a summary post about my WAP year and art efforts for the year in general, which I hope to put up before returning to work.
