<p>The course is hosted by <a href="https://www.evaboneva.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Eva Toorenent</a>, an artist with a very unique approach to mixing watercolours with digital colouring. I’ve never done any serious watercolour practice before so I was excited at the possibility of learning a new medium.</p>

<p>The first assignment of the course was 2 questions. I find these things rather cheesy and would usually skip them, but as I said in my previous blog post, doing these courses is my attempt to slow down and do the work.</p>

<p>I enjoyed the exercises she proposed but I don’t feel like they prepared me for working on a full illustration.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col col--9"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/art">art</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/21-draw">21draw</a></li></ul></div><div class="col text--right col--3"><a aria-label="Read more about The basics of illustrations" href="/blog/digital-illustration"><b>Read more</b></a></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy"><a href="/blog/bean-approach">Drawing cute creatures with beans</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2023-06-15T00:00:00.000Z">June 15, 2023</time> · <!-- -->4 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--12 authorCol_Hf19"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://github.com/kylies" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link"><img class="avatar__photo authorImage_XqGP" src="https://github.com/kylies.png" alt="Kylie"></a><div class="avatar__intro authorDetails_lV9A"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/kylies" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="authorName_yefp">Kylie</span></a></div><small class="authorTitle_nd0D" title="Admin">Admin</small><div class="authorSocials_rSDt"></div></div></div></div></div></header><div class="markdown"><p>After feeling pretty disappointed by the first creature course, I was excited after watching the introduction to ‘Designing Fun Animal Characters’ by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/rodgontheartist/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rodgon</a>.

<p>I was a little intimidated by this course because the idea of doing full illustrations still feels very challenging to me. Make a scene, draw a background, manage areas of focus and lighting. All the parts of drawing in one. Which I feel like I’ll never be ready for!</p>
<p>Thankfully this was another Tony Bancroft course and I’ve come to love his approach and his assignments.

<p>I wasn’t sure what to expect from this course. “Style” is a very nebulous thing, one that I’ve been told over and over again will develop with time and mastery of the basics. The course ended up focusing more on how you can work in different styles by taking different approaches and really iterating on your ideas.</p>
<p>The teacher broke down each part of the course with very well focused assignments and practical steps. With the idea being to draw the same character to match two different use cases. He was working on developing a Frankenstein’s Monster character while I made the mistake of choosing one of my own D&amp;D characters who I’ve iterated on a few times already. I say this was a mistake as choosing a fresh character would have given me more freedom to experiment instead of feeling locked in a previously established character design. But even with that mistake on my side I felt like I was able to learn a lot from the assignments.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col col--9"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/art">art</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/21-draw">21draw</a></li></ul></div><div class="col text--right col--3"><a aria-label="Read more about April Art Projects" href="/blog/stylized-characters"><b>Read more</b></a></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy"><a href="/blog/expressive-design">Adding character to characters</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2023-04-11T00:00:00.000Z">April 11, 2023</time> · <!-- -->4 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--12 authorCol_Hf19"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://github.com/kylies" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link"><img class="avatar__photo authorImage_XqGP" src="https://github.com/kylies.png" alt="Kylie"></a><div class="avatar__intro authorDetails_lV9A"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/kylies" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="authorName_yefp">Kylie</span></a></div><small class="authorTitle_nd0D" title="Admin">Admin</small><div class="authorSocials_rSDt"></div></div></div></div></div></header><div class="markdown"><p>After a month focused more on digital art practices I decided to go with more challenging courses for April. Not challenging on a technical level, but challenging because this has always been something I&#x27;ve felt my own drawings have lacked; energy and expression.</p>
<p>One of the March courses touched on this a little, going into the importance of silhouette and body language. I felt like that course had a lot of practical advice that was easy to start bringing in to my sketches. So I wanted to find a course that would keep elaborating on these approaches. Ending up on one titled <a href="https://www.21-draw.com/my-course/?id=4457&amp;lesson_id=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">&quot;How to Bring You Characters to Life.&quot;</a></p>
<p>I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect from the course as I knew it would be different from the typical, here&#x27;s how to understand anatomy that lots of art classes start with. Thankfully the instructor started by breaking down the main parts of a character that add life to an image.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col col--9"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/art">art</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/21-draw">21draw</a></li></ul></div><div class="col text--right col--3"><a aria-label="Read more about Adding character to characters" href="/blog/expressive-design"><b>Read more</b></a></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy"><a href="/blog/more-courses">March Lessons</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2023-03-26T00:00:00.000Z">March 26, 2023</time> · <!-- -->3 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--12 authorCol_Hf19"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://github.com/kylies" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link"><img class="avatar__photo authorImage_XqGP" src="https://github.com/kylies.png" alt="Kylie"></a><div class="avatar__intro authorDetails_lV9A"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/kylies" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="authorName_yefp">Kylie</span></a></div><small class="authorTitle_nd0D" title="Admin">Admin</small><div class="authorSocials_rSDt"></div></div></div></div></div></header><div class="markdown"><p>For March I tried out a few shorter courses, two focused on getting familiar with Procreate and one about bringing life to your poses.</p>

A yearly art challenged focused on making different types of mushrooms into creatures hosted by <a href="https://twitter.com/feefal_" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@feefal_</a>.</p>
<p>I stumbled across this challenge in December and kept it in mind for my year of art practice.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Funguary 2023 is soon upon us! A February drawing challenge based around fungi🍄
Here are the rules and all the prompts for the month! -- feef (@feefal_)</p>

<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="The Funguary Challenge" src="/assets/images/Funguary-80ec907906263727aaff7c007f18e8af.png" title="The rules of Funguary." width="1076" height="1212" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>A few years ago I was doing monthly challenges like this a few times a year. Those often meant drawing something new every day. For this challenge, I followed the suggested format of doing one a week to keep things more manageable.</p>
<p>In an attempt to make the process smoother for myself I spent time on Pinterest collecting images of all the suggested mushrooms for each week. With this reference collection I spent the first few days of the month sketching the mushrooms. I was hoping to do this for every week but it ended up taking more time then I expected.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Photo of my sketchbook" src="/assets/images/mushroom-sketches-27cb1d914090db29fdde3586ebcd19af.jpeg" title="Photo of my sketchbook, a page of mushrooms." width="818" height="1024" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>I also spent time doing thumbnails for a few of the weeks. I wanted to use that as a chance to push past my first idea and try out different compositions or concepts. But just like sketching mushroom, this took up a fair bit of my limited drawing time so towards the end I started to skip this step.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Simple thumbnails" src="/assets/images/funguary-thumbnails-74f827d0374d9f65d746a6e967a4aab1.jpg" title="Some quick thumbnails for brainstorming." width="1500" height="1026" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>There were a lot of fun mushrooms discovered during this month so I was a little sad to only choose 4 to focus on. I did end up trying to fit in a few of the other ones in to a few of the projects. These are my 4 final pieces:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="My 4 Funguary pieces" src="/assets/images/all-fungals-2023-141444e5020a0be387016dd199a5cc19.png" title="My four fungal friends." width="3000" height="3000" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>I resisted doing any cute lady mushrooms as that was my first instinct. But it felt too easy to just turn all the mushrooms into dresses. I&#x27;m not super happy with any of the pieces but there are parts that I like about all of them. I feel like #3 is decently creepy, I like how the shading came out on the body of #4 and I&#x27;m shocked I tried to do a scene in #2. I regret not tracking how much time was put into each one as I know I kicked out the last one in one day while the first one took at least 3.</p>
<p>Over the course of the month I did feel like I was improving and becoming more comfortable with Clip Studio Paint as time went on. It was nice to remember a few tricks to using the software too, proof that I hadn&#x27;t forgotten everything I learned a few years ago.</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll do another challenge like this for a few months as it ate away at my actual art lesson time. But it was very nice to take a break from figure drawing humans all the time.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/art">art</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><article class="margin-bottom--xl"><header><h2 class="title_f1Hy"><a href="/blog/getting-started">Getting started with 21Draw</a></h2><div class="container_mt6G margin-vert--md"><time datetime="2023-02-12T00:00:00.000Z">February 12, 2023</time> · <!-- -->2 min read</div><div class="margin-top--md margin-bottom--sm row"><div class="col col--12 authorCol_Hf19"><div class="avatar margin-bottom--sm"><a href="https://github.com/kylies" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="avatar__photo-link"><img class="avatar__photo authorImage_XqGP" src="https://github.com/kylies.png" alt="Kylie"></a><div class="avatar__intro authorDetails_lV9A"><div class="avatar__name"><a href="https://github.com/kylies" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="authorName_yefp">Kylie</span></a></div><small class="authorTitle_nd0D" title="Admin">Admin</small><div class="authorSocials_rSDt"></div></div></div></div></div></header><div class="markdown"><p>Towards the end of 2022 I had already started thinking of 2023 as a year I wanted to make more of an effort to get back into drawing. I missed being creative and hated watching my large collection of expensive markers slowly dry out and die.</p>
<p>While browsing Twitter one night I saw an artist I followed had recently published an art course on <a href="https://www.21-draw.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">21Draw</a>. I&#x27;d never heard of the website before and was surprised to see that it was possibly the perfect fit for my 2023 goals. Online art lessons focused on core skills and even digital tools I was already familiar with.</p>
<p>I don&#x27;t usually like buying something as soon as I see it but I got sucked in by the countdown clock at the top of the page promoting an End of Year Discount. 2 subscriptions for 1/3rd the price of a normal signal subscription. And I only had 5 hours left to take advantage!</p>
<p>So anyway, 30 minutes after finding the site I was registered and ready to go with a whole year of access.</p>
<p>While I was very excited to get to the courses focused on character design, Clip Studio, and Procreate, I forced myself to choose a beginner course as my first lesson. Then after the first lesson to stick to some core lessons like anatomy and perspective. So basically figure drawing all the time.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Screenshot of the course page" src="/assets/images/figure-drawing-class-1eb55938e3a38f3898f1946d35969282.png" title="Figure drawing class" width="800" height="866" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>I&#x27;m now entering month two and I&#x27;m finding my time to devote to course material fading. Balancing two D&amp;D campaigns, other hobbies, and drawing is still a struggle. But thanks to the February drawing challenged called #Funguary over on Twitter I&#x27;m still putting in some drawing time every few days. Just a little less focused then I&#x27;d like it to be. I&#x27;ll talk about #Funguary in my next post.</p>
<p>Hoping that in March I&#x27;ll have more then just a few figure drawing sketches to share.</p></div><footer class="row docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/art">art</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/21-draw">21draw</a></li></ul></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav" aria-label="Blog list page navigation"><a class="pagination-nav__link pagination-nav__link--prev" href="/blog/page/7"><div class="pagination-nav__label">Newer entries</div></a><a class="pagination-nav__link pagination-nav__link--next" href="/blog/page/9"><div class="pagination-nav__label">Older entries</div></a></nav></main></div></div></div><section><div><webring-css site="https://kymira.ca"></webring-css></div></section><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container container-fluid"><div class="row footer__links"><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">Pages</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/blog">Blog</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/docs/intro">D&amp;D Campaigns</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/about">About</a></li></ul></div><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">Community</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/kymira.bsky.social" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">BluSky<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_nPIU"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://cara.app/kymira" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">Cara<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_nPIU"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></li></ul></div><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">More</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuDQ7ixvCci_cvZ9f9jznVA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">Altar Stone<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_nPIU"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://sophiefromhowls.itch.io/love-in-the-time-of-spellphage-01" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">Littos<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_nPIU"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://www.kymira.ca/blog/rss.xml" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">RSS Feed<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_nPIU"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></li></ul></div></div><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">Copyright © 2025 Kymira, Inc.
