Week 2 has been a rather slow one. The time change hit me really hard so I felt a little ill the first few days just from my sleep getting messed with. Then my other projects and volunteer work took up a fair bit of space on other days. And today I’m off to get a tattoo which likely won’t leave me in a “go make art” kind of mood after either. So we’re in challenging times!

## Backgrounds

While I only did two backgrounds this week I am rather happy with them. The first was this big storm scene. I did some research into painting storm clouds and then also into waves (which I often find difficult). The lightning looks rather unnatural due to being from a lightning brush but I kind of like how much it stands out as it is the focus of the pieces.

The second background has a lot of simple cheats for doing woodsy backdrops but it takes a lot of time to fill all the layers this kind of piece needs. So I spent two evenings chipping away at this one. But I feel like the shading does pull things together and convey depth in the scene. I could probably make it even stronger by doing more obvious lighting but I was starting to feel like I needed to move on… to resting on the couch and watching tv.

## Website update

This is such a small website change that I suspect no one would notice unless I point it out. But I started using my own favicon to replace the default Docusaurus one (even though I do love the Docusaurus dinosaur). It’s now this guy, which was an attempt at making a 16x16px squirrel for a possible GameBoy game but I think it looks a little more dog-like? But at least some sort of creature-like but I like that it might not be obvious.

## Conclusion

This coming week I’m going to try to start working on writing. I’m a little uncertain about this as I’m pulled to do most of my writing in Google Docs as that’s where most of my work lives but due to the formatting of things it will probably be easiest to work in the text editor that I use to open the Ren’py code files.

I find myself already missing my weekly art practice as it was so much easier to only to commit to things for 1 week at a time.
