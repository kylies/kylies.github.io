Week 30! It feels like a small number when compared to all numbers, but it’s pretty good when compared to 52. And there are still a few more weeks to go in the year. I’m starting to try to figure out how I want to approach art practice next year now. I don’t think I want to keep doing WAP guided practice, I feel like I should get out of the comfort zone and try to move into working on complete pieces. Or another idea is to do more Master Studies.

Having weekly homework has been great for having something to work on every day but it’s also been a fair bit of pressure to get through the practice every week and get a blog post out for each one. But we’ll see, I have no idea what 2025 is going to look like yet so don’t want to make any big commitments.

## Day 1 - Drawing from imagination

So I actually had two pet sugar gliders from about the age of 14 to 21, so you’d think I’d have a pretty decent mental model of what they look like. But it has been more than 12 years since I’ve been around one…

## Day 4 - Style studies

I was fairly surprised to find that there aren’t too many stylized takes on sugar gliders. Possibly because they aren’t a North American creature. We had endless sources for creatures like raccoons, rabbits, pigeons, etc. But also Pinterest is a pretty garbage website as when I go to collect my references at the end of the week there are suddenly more results and I struggle to find the ones I used. Are there results that I only see on iPad, that are different than one desktop?

## Day 5 - Drawing from imagination

Took a bit to find my groove on day 5. But I felt pretty confident that if I gave myself enough time I could refine the sketches into solid versions of sugar gliders.

## Conclusion

Have a fair bit going on for the next two weeks so I’m not sure if I’ll have enough time to get through two whole WAP practices. I’ve started an ambitious possible Altar Stone animation but so far it involves drawing 100 trees and I don’t know if I’m going to still like it by the time I reach tree 100.
