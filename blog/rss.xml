            <description><![CDATA[Week 25 - Gymnastic bars]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I added this theme to my list, I didn’t realise it was going to coincide with the olympics. Thought there would be some good photography of bodies in motion with gymnasts as a theme. I hadn’t meant to be so narrow but ended up only using references of people on the bars. Then when I got deeper into it I thought there would be some more unique poses, but people seem to love the shot of a person looking long.</p>

<p>When I started the week I thought I’d find more references where people would be simply hanging from the bar. Maybe warming up? Well I saw none.</p>

<p>Lot of C curves going on.</p>

<p>Days 3 and 4 become basically the same thing on anatomy days now. Trying to think up a different kind of challenge for day 4 other than continuing regular reference studies.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/wap-25.3.1-776a9cdf22fa6bb2b1bb2b71db77f814.jpg" width="3000" height="2000" class="img_ev3q"></p>

<p>As usual, there wasn’t much to find style wise for gymnasts. So I treated it as another reference study, with some added difficulty of the up angled shot. Struggled with that one a lot, trying to understand where the legs and body were hiding.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/wap-25.4.1-2b3305291223eb1550f1cfcac93513bd.jpg" width="3556" height="2000" class="img_ev3q"></p>

<p>Since I found the photography fairly limited angle wise, I’m trying to push myself on drawing from imagination on anatomy weeks. So I’m trying out some “rotate shapes in your head” kind of exercise here. Well in one of my attempts, the overhead, downwards angle. I feel like it turned out even, aside from losing track of what the centre body is doing. The other 2 were more straightforward attempts to practise basic proportions.</p>

<p>I forgot that I didn’t share the final version of my Elden Ring / Honeymoon piece. It’s probably my favourite piece of the year. I see it everyday on my phone screen and it still doesn’t make me cringe.</p>

<p>I’m not sure what I’m going to work on this week. I’m torn between taking a week off from art to do some website stuff since I’ll be away from my computer next week. Or just do one final practice week before travelling next week. Also want to keep learning some Godot stuff to see if I can get a nice setup together for getting things out faster. I have a new character and world tileset to play with from <a href="https://www.oryxdesignlab.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oryx Design Lab</a>. Already have a space with a character moving around. Next goals will be to try adding some visual effects and maybe pathing NPCs so they walk around on their own.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[Week]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week was a return to creatures, with the common house sparrow as our subject. I also attended an animation course last weekend so I’ll share some stuff from that, and I’ve been working on a new Altar Stone video which was more technically demanding than art demanding for the last few weeks.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="day-1---drawing-from-imagination">Day 1 - Drawing from imagination<a href="https://kymira.ca/blog/wap-24#day-1---drawing-from-imagination" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Day 1 - Drawing from imagination" title="Direct link to Day 1 - Drawing from imagination">​</a></h2>
<p>While I chose sparrows to continue on the most common animals in Montreal, it turns out I can only imagine them as basic small birds when not using a reference.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/wap-24.1-2f6c44cb7769c0827248e8513ff5b918.jpg" width="2838" height="1960" class="img_ev3q"></p>

<p>With a reference they still kind of look like a basic small bird, but then the colouration patterns really become important for identification. I ended up focusing on male sparrows as they have a really distinctive black chest marking.</p>

<p>Tried out a variety of styles. But I think I like the classic more detailed sparrow the most.</p>

<p>After hearing the most recent Altar Stone track I got hooked on the idea of pixel art for the video. I’m not great at pixel aren’t and I don’t love it. Watching people making tiny pixel changes and getting a whole new character feels like magic to me. So I got the idea to look for open source assets instead of making my own.</p>
<p>I also had a few ideas for the basic animation but while ideating on how I would approach it, it became clear that this would be something easier to do in a game engine than in an animation program. I had poked at Godot a few months ago out of curiosity at the 4.0 launch and the new Brackey video tutorial. So I understood some of the basic steps I knew I’d have to do.</p>
<p>It turned out to be harder than I hoped to find good free assets. There are plenty out there but when you already have an idea in your head it’s hard to accept the limited options. But I eventually chose a tileset, a cute bat for decorations, and some characters who don’t look too ridiculous in the setting.</p>
<p>And then I made the “level” aka the walking course.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Screenshot of a pixel art platformer in Godot" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/cave-level-8c0bd77e3d58fccb1f3c8e7b2e34704d.png" width="1314" height="846" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>I got the basics of moving the character around, controlling the camera and working with collision layers. Then needed my wife’s help for follower logic code to execute the idea I had of “adventurer party walking”. Final product coming soon to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@altarstone" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Altar Stone YouTube channel!</a></p>

<p>A few months ago I signed up to a <a href="https://x.com/spencerwan" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spencer Wan</a> animation course focused on visual effects. Since effects, instead of full on character animations, is what I have been focusing on in my Alter Stone videos, I thought this course sounded like the perfect fit.</p>
<p>It ended up being 30C+ the day of the course. That’s in the apartment even. So it was the most comfortable 4.5 hours to spend at a computer. But even just the first hour of the program felt enlightening. I did my notes in Clip Studio and then tried to follow the animations steps in SquidToon but the course moved pretty quickly due to time constraints (it was an ambitious agenda!) and only managed to complete the first lightning step by step:</p>

<p>Overall it was really great and I find myself trying to find Spencer’s catalogue of work and video to see what else I can learn as he was great at breaking down concepts and approaches to very doable chunks.</p>

<p>It was a big week for projects. I have a head full of animation ideas now and want to jump into some more big pieces to put them to use. Might get one more week of art in before I got on vacation for a week. It feels nice as I feel like I'm having ideas for projects at a rate I can no longer keep up with. Nice to have the creative sparks and energy firing at the same time.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[Week 22 and 23]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’m a blog post behind in WAPs so I'm going to cover the last two weeks in one.</p>
<p>The first week was an attempt at drawing myself. I’ve wanted a self drawn avatar to use online my whole online life but I’ve never managed to draw one I’m happy enough with. And spoiler I still haven’t.</p>
<p>The week after was skulls, which was a theme that was probably too broad. Lots of skull are very different from one another, so choosing something like Human Skulls probably would have given the week more focus.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="day-1---myself">Day 1 - Myself<a href="https://kymira.ca/blog/wap-22-23#day-1---myself" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Day 1 - Myself" title="Direct link to Day 1 - Myself">​</a></h2>
<p>A few attempts at drawing myself without looking at myself.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/wap-22.1-051dbd893197e33149fa1db065e5ef9c.jpg" width="3071" height="1968" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>Starting already a step behind one that I did earlier this year which I don't love.</p>

<p>For day two I pulled up some general character art to try out some different styles of drawing faces. This turned out to be more difficult than I expected as it’s not easy to just get a list of different looks so there was a lot of Pinterest.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Quick hand sketches using references" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/wap-22.2-73ee234f15e909f04f61fbbaf32a6cb9.jpg" width="2987" height="1761" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="day-3---myself---reference-studies">Day 3 - Myself - Reference studies<a href="https://kymira.ca/blog/wap-22-23#day-3---myself---reference-studies" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Day 3 - Myself - Reference studies" title="Direct link to Day 3 - Myself - Reference studies">​</a></h2>
<p>On day two I went through my phone and used old selfies as reference. I haven’t taken many selfies in the last few years, it’s a habit I’m gotten out of. Partially out of a desire to have fewer photos of myself online and just wanting to take photos of cats and squirrels instead.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/wap-22.3-3103a2ff3e14628ec632c0aba9297219.jpg" width="3072" height="2139" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="day-4--5---myself---sketch-progress">Day 4 &amp; 5 - Myself - Sketch progress<a href="https://kymira.ca/blog/wap-22-23#day-4--5---myself---sketch-progress" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Day 4 &amp; 5 - Myself - Sketch progress" title="Direct link to Day 4 &amp; 5 - Myself - Sketch progress">​</a></h2>
<p>I took another stab at sketching myself after my girlfriend voted for bowl cut with bangs as the most Me looking, look. One of the hardest things about trying to cartoonify myself is that I don’t have a central feature to focus on. Hair is a big identifier for a cartoon and mine changes pretty drastically over 6 months, so even when I do have an avatar I like (Thanks Catarina <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/radiantlethe.bsky.social" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@radiantlethe</a> for previous avatars!) it’s outdated extremely quickly. These days I have 2-3 pairs of glasses that I swap between and are all pretty different. And my face is very… average. Which I mean more in like, my forehead size is very average, not distinguishable, same thing about my nose. My lips are a little different due to surgery but that’s not enough to make a face look like me. Square chin is maybe the strongest face shape feature that can be leaned on.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/wap-22.4-de7f57dd7e4ad242dd07a4b1c7bc6d80.jpg" width="3069" height="1295" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>And then I took it digital. It’s shocking how quickly sketches go from looking okay to looking ridiculous.</p>

<p>I thought I had a decent grasp on human skulls but putting pencil to paper really makes my brain want to stop imagining things clearly.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/wap-23.1-ecf0689140868d92477db2cf74e3bd0c.jpg" width="3058" height="1250" class="img_ev3q"></p>

<p>Skulls were much easier with references but there are so many kinds and they’re all pretty interesting. There seems to be a lot of interest in cat skulls so those come up a lot.</p>

<p>Drawing more detailed skulls was fairly relaxing. There’s a comfort in them being solid objects.</p>

<p>I get into a bit of a bird skull rut with the week. It felt easier than a lot of the other ones.</p>

<p>Last year I bought a fresh sketchbook for carrying around, taking to the park and traveling and all that. This morning I used the last page! I picked this up while I was still trying to get into the swing of doing art more often. After a few years of barely drawing at all it felt like such a long shot to fill a new sketchbook.</p>
<p>I’m a notorious sticker hoarder so after getting this sketchbook I put every sticker I got across the course of the year on to it, which has made it into a nice little visual memory of a lot of activities.</p>

<p>So I had been hoping to end the week with a self portrait avatar I would use, but haven’t. Skulls went pretty okay. And I bought a new sketchbook so it kind of feels like starting a new chapter.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[Week]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I didn’t complete my WAP exercises last week. It’s my first time not getting through all 5 exercises but it was an anatomy week which often feel a little weird on the last two days. I hadn’t even found any stylistic waltz references to use for day 4.</p>
<p>But it’s not a lack of references that kept me away. I had a piece that, initially, was going to be rather simple but had turned into one of my most ambitious pieces yet (will share progress later in this post). One of the reasons I have such a structured practice schedule is that I haven’t had many ideas for projects and these focused weeks help me to keep practising and creating even when my head is empty. So the idea that I’m so taken with a new piece feels like my creativity is starting to stir again (it only took 1.5 years). So I’m pretty happy to put weekly practice to the side if it means completing a full piece that I’m excited about.</p>
<p>Besides the new piece getting most of my creative attention, I’ve been dealing with some pretty back upper back/neck pain. So while I want to spend multiple hours a day working on art I’m having to take many breaks and also just limit the amount of time I spend with my head bent in hopes of not making the pain worse. And don’t even get me started on how the current heat wave is completely sapping all my energy.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="day-1---drawing-from-imagination">Day 1 - Drawing from imagination<a href="https://kymira.ca/blog/wap-21#day-1---drawing-from-imagination" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Day 1 - Drawing from imagination" title="Direct link to Day 1 - Drawing from imagination">​</a></h2>
<p>One of the reasons I chose waltz as a reference is that it’s a fairly structured dance, almost stiff as dances go. But I also wanted to get into practising pieces with multiple characters where they are touching. Along with the challenge of having most of the pose hidden by a dress. Day 1 poses were rather simple from my brain.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/wap-21.1-54bd3c65d194eb0e102a1df3554a79bc.jpg" width="2549" height="4048" class="img_ev3q"></p>

<p>I still think I should be doing this exercise faster than I usually do. Especially with anatomy weeks as I should be trying to capture the movement flow or dynamics of a pose instead of trying to get it exactly right.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Quick hand sketches using references" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/wap-21.2-e3ff40f50e8bad8d3f17ecccf30f5fdc.jpg" width="3072" height="2153" class="img_ev3q"></p>

<p>Only did 2 pieces as I felt like since there are 2 people in each it’s like doing 4 practices. This is where I really tried to problem solve the pose of the figure I can’t see clearly. The nice part of waltz is that the two people are often moving in tandem so it means copying the more visible pose and applying it to the partner.</p>

<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="new-elden-ring-piece">New Elden Ring Piece<a href="https://kymira.ca/blog/wap-21#new-elden-ring-piece" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to New Elden Ring Piece" title="Direct link to New Elden Ring Piece">​</a></h2>
<p>So I shared a version of my Elden Ring character last week. Ever since the Shadow of the Erdtree DLC came out we’ve been playing for at least 2 hours every day. It’s a lot of Elden Ring. Because this was our main activity after our wedding we’ve been joking that we honeymooned in the Shadow Realm (the new Elden Ring region). We have a collection of video game screenshots as a couple, Animal Crossing, Pokemon Sw/Sh, but we can’t co-op in Elden Ring, so if I wanted our characters together I would have to do it myself.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/er-honeymoon-base-95c9157f9680140ad460a2575488f09d.jpg" width="2395" height="3232" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>I’ll keep working on this for a few more days. I feel like I’m in the final stages but the background is giving me a pretty hard time. I’m struggling to balance the colours and details in a way that the background doesn’t take away too much from the characters in the foreground, while also trying to not introduce too many colours to keep things balanced. But I keep finding a new thing about the image I don’t love and then re-working it lol.</p>
<p>I’m hoping to focus on the last bit of lighting and shadows and then push the background “further back” so it doesn’t steal attention. All while trying to not make the image too dark or muddied.</p>

<p>Going to spend a few more days on the Elden Ring Honeymoon piece and then try to get into my new WAP subject. But I also have a whole other Elden Ring piece idea which I know is going to try to claim all my attention.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[Week 20 - Redraw]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Took a bit of an art break over the last two weeks while getting married. Still did some work on an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@altarstone" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Altar Stone</a> animation and also drew my Elden Ring character as we’re deep into the DLC.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Greyscale image of squatting Elden Ring character" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/er-blorbo1-65a23fc8cb1a747db32901afd26c26f9.jpg" width="1738" height="2215" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>This week kicked off more focused practice time and I’m returning with:
1 - Focusing on a single piece for a week
2 - A childhood re-draw</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="day-1---pose">Day 1 - Pose<a href="https://kymira.ca/blog/wap-20#day-1---pose" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Day 1 - Pose" title="Direct link to Day 1 - Pose">​</a></h2>
<p>Here’s the original piece I started with.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/butterfly-princess-2006-2d794045b2691804a18f2c970e1ae35d.jpg" width="1435" height="1796" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>I can’t remember any of the context for the design or composition. All I know is that this was done in pencil crayon and was likely one of my main pieces for art class when I was 17. So big into my Always Online internet years.</p>
<p>I’m following the workflow that was covered in the One Week Character program, so day 1 was mostly gathering reference, choosing a pose and getting the composition down.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="day-2---outfit">Day 2 - Outfit<a href="https://kymira.ca/blog/wap-20#day-2---outfit" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Day 2 - Outfit" title="Direct link to Day 2 - Outfit">​</a></h2>
<p>The outfit was already established in the original but I made some minor changes to the wing designs to make them more easily recognizable as Butterfly. I deleted my sketch layers so I don’t have a great image for this day. This is a screenshot of the video replay in Procreate.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/wap-20.2-855c0d53389336441cbb12956d63bea7.jpg" width="1927" height="1798" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="day-3---colours">Day 3 - Colours<a href="https://kymira.ca/blog/wap-20#day-3---colours" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Day 3 - Colours" title="Direct link to Day 3 - Colours">​</a></h2>
<p>I generated a palette from a monarch butterfly dress which gave me a good starting point.  I lightened the colour of the dress by a fair bit as I didn’t want to work so heavily with black while also assuming I would end up darkening everything in the shading phase.</p>
<p>I also changed the hair colour as the bright pink was just too random for me. Or at least 35 year old me.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/wap-20.3-aa2c3bb800742568b7c4b9d7274c8d16.jpg" width="2640" height="2397" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="day-4--5---shading-and-details">Day 4 &amp; 5 - Shading and details<a href="https://kymira.ca/blog/wap-20#day-4--5---shading-and-details" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Day 4 &amp; 5 - Shading and details" title="Direct link to Day 4 &amp; 5 - Shading and details">​</a></h2>
<p>I didn’t take any inbetween screenshots of this process. I’ve found a trick to how I approach shading. Often I don’t go hard enough on my shadows so I figured out I could just duplicate my Multiply layer I was using and then the shadows really pop.</p>
<p>I spent a rather long time on the magic circle, trying to make it look interesting. Then went hard on the rim lighting where the body is closest to the circle. Just a fair bit of experimental choices to try to make the circle pop will not pulling in all the attention by being too bright.</p>
<p>Something that was new for me was colouring in my black lines. I painted over them with an airbrush to bring them closer to their nearest colour and I feel like this does a nice job of smoothing things out. The place with the most black lines no longer draws in a lot of attention by being a place of high contrast. I’ll try this out again in the future but maybe will commit to it harder instead of doing light airbrushing.</p>
<p>I probably could have spent time adding more details and texture to the skin and the long part of the dress. I wrapped up the piece Thursday night as I was generally happy with it and didn’t want to stress out my back muscles too much more by adding another day of fine tuning.</p>

<p>Going to make next week an anatomy week by drawing waltz poses. However I am a little worried that most references will have people in rather ornate outfits, making it difficult to see exact limb poses.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[Designing a character in a week]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week I took a break from my usual practice schedule to participate in <a href="https://paintable.cc/one-week-character/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Paintables’s One Week Character class</a>. The students were provided with briefs to choose from and then focus on trying to work with that brief while following <a href="https://davidbelliveau.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">David Belliveau’s</a> workflow. He did live videos from Monday to Friday covering each stage of the process and answering questions.</p>
<p>It’s a good workflow overall, but I struggled to tune in to the sessions so did everything a day or two behind. There was a whole Discord community for it but I found it was too busy and messy, the way I often find Discord servers to be. But it was a good experience and it helped me stay focused on one piece for a whole week and be pretty happy with the end product.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="day-1---figure-drawing-and-finding-a-pose">Day 1 - Figure drawing and finding a pose<a href="https://kymira.ca/blog/owc#day-1---figure-drawing-and-finding-a-pose" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Day 1 - Figure drawing and finding a pose" title="Direct link to Day 1 - Figure drawing and finding a pose">​</a></h2>
<p>I wasn’t hype on any of the five briefs that were provided, even by the time day one rolled around. I found them all to be extremely basic and straightforward character wise. This made it pretty difficult to get started, so I spent a good 20 minutes scrolling Pinterest while watching the first video.</p>
<p>The first thing I decided on was ‘scythe’. They’d been on my mind since the launch of Arlecchino in Genshim Impact…</p>
<p>This led to looking for poses of people holding poles that could have a blade added to the end of them. Ended up with this reference and this base figure. By this point Fallen Angel felt like the most logical choice from the briefs.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/OWC-Day1-190339e7ec14b32fb18ec3d2248e7106.jpg" width="2732" height="2048" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="day-2---clothing">Day 2 - Clothing<a href="https://kymira.ca/blog/owc#day-2---clothing" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Day 2 - Clothing" title="Direct link to Day 2 - Clothing">​</a></h2>
<p>Day 2 focused on dressing the figure from day 1. I was pretty familiar with this step from last years courses and used parts of those approaches for this. Search for references and ideas then work with blocking in shapes to focus on balance on composition. I created 3 different ones during the course of the video for the day.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/OWC-Day2-f525ea3e1c84f62dee50b06ad11fb922.jpg" width="3706" height="1906" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="day-3---colours">Day 3 - Colours<a href="https://kymira.ca/blog/owc#day-3---colours" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Day 3 - Colours" title="Direct link to Day 3 - Colours">​</a></h2>
<p>The video for day 3 started with linework so I felt behind instantly as I’m still kind of stuck in having linework for a lot of my work. This day ended up taking a fair bit of time as I did a cleanup pass on the clothing, then a true linework layer after that. And then got around to trying out colours.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/OWC-Day3-e9d82107ccc41bc7365d8cc1b1393c54.jpg" width="2826" height="3664" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="day-4---details">Day 4 - Details<a href="https://kymira.ca/blog/owc#day-4---details" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Day 4 - Details" title="Direct link to Day 4 - Details">​</a></h2>
<p>Another thing that made the challenge more… challenging, was that colouring details other than clothing weren’t covered until day 4. The main outfit detail I had was all the metal and honestly, I don’t have too much experience with metal. I’ve done a lot with flat greys but haven’t done a lot of shading techniques. David’s little tutorials were very helpful for how to approach these details. Choosing a reference and really focusing on it to learn a style to then apply to the parts of the character that require that. An exercise I’ll try to fit into one of my practice weeks.</p>
<p>A lot of this day was spent trying to develop how I wanted the metal to look. I don’t love it but I started with the boots and I am pretty happy with the boots. I feel like they have the right amount of details.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/OWC-Day4-6bd2e854bba927d5b03dab0c1cc34ff2.jpg" width="2826" height="3664" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="day-5---finishing-details">Day 5 - Finishing details<a href="https://kymira.ca/blog/owc#day-5---finishing-details" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Day 5 - Finishing details" title="Direct link to Day 5 - Finishing details">​</a></h2>
<p>The stuff focused on day 5 was a lot of the stuff that I often skip over. Usually after I accomplish the stuff from day 4 I’m feeling fairly over a piece. The big emphasis of the lessons over the week was to skip to a workflow. It helps to know which part to work on next and in which order. I found this very helpful in sticking with the piece for this long, even feeling like I was doing something different every day since each focus is a rather different creative challenge.</p>
<p>This day was re-doing the breastplate which I wasn’t happy with, finishing up any textures I wanted to add and doubling down on the shadows and highlights.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/OWC-Day5-7e566ca1a70e1a9f2ce5209c73b37db6.jpg" width="2826" height="3664" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="conclusion">Conclusion<a href="https://kymira.ca/blog/owc#conclusion" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Conclusion" title="Direct link to Conclusion">​</a></h2>
<p>I wasn’t sure I was going to make it through this week. I didn’t like the community aspect, I wasn’t sure if I was going to learn anything different from the previous courses I had done, and I went to the movies when there was a chance the videos would be taken down and I wouldn’t have a chance to watch the last one. But they ended up being still available Sunday morning and I was able to get my last details in then.</p>
<p>It feels good to finish a digital piece, and to not skip on the details. A lot does really come together in those last few stages. Given that this feels like a success I’m thinking of changing up my practice schedule once again. Along with adding a week every month to focus on anatomy, I might also devote a week to completing a single piece to put my practice into place.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>I’ve been trying to jot down little notes about key traits you want to capture when drawing specific creatures. While also noticing what gets changed for cartoon versions. For chameleons almost everyone changes their tiny eyes into huge eyes. A classic cutifying move but to me it loses a key chameleon trait. For my final day I did a chameleon with regular eyes and then did a copy with the cartoon style eyes. It does change of the face drastically, making it way easier to work with expressions. But I still don’t love it, the swivel eyes are so good and unique.</p>

<p>This might be the week with the least amount of change form day 1 to day 5... maybe I already knew chameleon's pretty well.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week is another one pulled from old childhood art, another book cover I made featuring a crying sea turtle. I loved turtles a lot when I was a kid. Franklin was my favourite toy, I had almost every book, even dressed as Franklin for Halloween once. These turtles are not Franklin turtles though, this week is sea turtles only.</p>

<p>Sea turtles have a nice consistent shape to them, it makes sense, way more than hyena’s at least.</p>

<p>I know there are other types of sea turtles out there but I ended up with a lot of either green sea turtles or hawksbills.</p>

<p>I was kind of surprised at how few stylized sea turtles I could find on Pinterest. Once again babies dominated and there was a lot of Disney influence going around.</p>

<p>A little rougher than I was hoping. The below shot with the front fins pulled in was ambitious and kind of loses its shape.</p>

<p>Falling behind on blog posts, at this exact moment I already have all the art pieces completed for number 19. I also just signed up for a mini character design challenge next week so I may break from the format for a week.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s time for another anatomy week. This week I went with volleyball poses. I played a lot of volleyball between the ages of ~14-18 so I’m pretty familiar with the sport, but it has been a long time since I’ve seen any volleyball in action.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="day-1---drawing-from-imagination">Day 1 - Drawing from imagination<a href="https://kymira.ca/blog/wap-17#day-1---drawing-from-imagination" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Day 1 - Drawing from imagination" title="Direct link to Day 1 - Drawing from imagination">​</a></h2>
<p>I didn’t hate these sketches after doing them which is a pretty rare day 1 feeling.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/wap-17.1-05ac165b67eac4564aeb96a0aedfb304.jpg" width="3072" height="2085" class="img_ev3q"></p>

<p>There’s plenty of volleyball photography out there, and some really good action poses since there’s a lot of quick movements during a game.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Quick hand sketches using references" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/wap-17.2-34b374dcbebd1a7813e366c9a67b24d8.jpg" width="3062" height="1909" class="img_ev3q"></p>

<p>Each day feels like it's getting a little cleaner.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/wap-17.3-e5676cf209498e406cc29251a68b889a.jpg" width="3622" height="2207" class="img_ev3q"></p>

<p>People have done some really dramatic angles in their volleyball poses. I still rarely play around with perspective, especially with the anatomy weeks since I still want to get more consistent at proportions but also foreshortening.</p>

<p>I didn’t push too much outside my comfort zone with this one but I did try to do an aerial angle on one. I can now see that the head is off angle but overall it feels like a small baby step to playing with perspective more.</p>

<p>On top of my weekly practice I also did a colour study this week. A common practice method I’ve been wanting to do more is to try from movie stills. Movies are heavily invested in lighting and composition so learning from movies you like is a good way to learn.</p>
<p>I did direct colour picks from this still from The Fall, one of my favourite movies. The whole movie is rather muted but the characters themselves often have a very vibrant colour as part of their outfit. I really like this bright red and gold outfit in this scene of beautiful stucco structures. Next time I’ll try choosing the colours manually instead of colour picking them with the eye drop tool to see if I can guess the colours because when using the eye drop I’m often surprised by how much darker or lighter a colour is once I see it on the colour wheel.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week I went for hyenas. They’ve always been pretty cool and feel like another “weird dog” type. But surprise surprise, I actually learned a lot about hyenas this week. First one being, they aren’t that closely related to dogs. Instead they are closer to the cat family but their closest animal relative is actually the meerkat.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="day-1---drawing-from-imagination">Day 1 - Drawing from imagination<a href="https://kymira.ca/blog/wap-16#day-1---drawing-from-imagination" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Day 1 - Drawing from imagination" title="Direct link to Day 1 - Drawing from imagination">​</a></h2>
<p>I was very over confident on day 1. It disappeared as soon as I started sketching. Very much a ‘head empty’ kind of day where I feel like I did just draw some weird dogs. Can’t even say these are recognizably hyenas.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/wap-16.1-b9a573e31a4f582dfe4043a2063be64a.jpg" width="2952" height="1146" class="img_ev3q"></p>

<p>A little better with references. But already I’m feeling like this animal is a challenge. Its shapes are un-intuitive to me.</p>

<p>One of my goals with hyenas was to avoid having only Lion King art for reference. Which actually didn’t turn out to be that hard. People love to draw hyenas, possibly because their faces are so expressive.</p>

<p>The fun facts about hyena’s I learned came from this <a href="https://www.pinterest.ca/pin/598978819224783588/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">anatomy study by BitterSweetDisease on Deviantart</a>. However I’m not the first person to go searching for their account. I found a forum of someone else trying to find their original stuff saying the account has been deactivated. Which is unfortunate because the pieces that have made it to Pinterest are well done.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’m two weeks behind on blog posts so I’m gonna keep these two rather short to get them out. This week was another childhood animal revisit: Penguins.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/kid-penguin-32af8256922f836c78ec9b50541e9988.jpg" width="840" height="1325" class="img_ev3q"></p>

<p>Penguins were honestly pretty easy from the get go. They have a pretty iconic yet simple shape. However, non of these day one guys are any specific species of penguin and are more just my mental model for what a penguin is.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/wap-15.1-9c7a26c6035a901c5ff3976abe0a1d6e.jpg" width="3011" height="1825" class="img_ev3q"></p>

<p>I did struggle with movement on day 1. Other than walk around, stand around, and swim, what to penguins do? I had forgotten about how more active they could look when moving about.</p>

<p>By this day I’m starting to wonder if I should have chosen a specific species to focus on as there is a fair bit of variety between different penguins.</p>

<p>I made a mistake here in that a lot of the styled images are baby penguins. Very cute but I hadn’t meant for that to become the focus.</p>

<p>This is one of the first times where I feel like there is almost zero change from day 1 to day 5. Partially due to the lack of pose options and partially because I really rushed through this day 5. I’m not sure if I should force myself to get day 5 done in a sloppy way or if not even doing it is better as I’m unlikely to learn anything if I just force something on paper without giving it conscious thought.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[Week 14 - Hawks]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Some of my upcoming animal week themes are based on photos of artwork from my childhood that my mom has been sending me. This week comes from this ink hawk I did when I was 14. Started to get into calligraphy pens and ink in general. Honestly, this is something I don’t cringe at and I think I would struggle to recreate today.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/wap-14.0-6ff0e1953b62ca2260e7d80a39557d5d.jpg" width="1200" height="1600" class="img_ev3q"></p>

<p>I spent a lot of time drawing birds when I was young, especially birds of prey. They were a big favourite of mine.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/wap-14.1-cbf82bd01a21d25b85dd1b892077cf7d.png" width="3024" height="1805" class="img_ev3q"></p>

<p>It felt easy enough to get into draw hawks again with a reference. Nearly all my references are red-tailed hawks due to the algorithm.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Quick hand sketches using references" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/wap-14.2-8d19779149cb196fd2c9a0221a713a22.jpg" width="3072" height="1890" class="img_ev3q"></p>

<p>I think I’ve been rushing my reference studies the last few weeks. I have been feeling very pressed for time, or at least time where I have creative energy. After that blind study video I’m thinking I should prioritise writing down a list of my main takeaways after doing the studies. As I find I’m ending up on day 5 and don’t have a foundation to work up from.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/wap-14.3.1-f823e43f417d2e3714d28c5da605db9d.jpg" width="3000" height="2000" class="img_ev3q"></p>

<p>There are a fair bit of stylized hawks out there but I did have a hard time finding some that I really liked. This first one feels like a pretty forward flat cartoon style.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/wap-14.4.1-ee16813d52cc71299479106117242bb9.jpg" width="3000" height="2000" class="img_ev3q"></p>

<p>This piece got my attention pretty quickly. It’s way more stylized than anything I do but I like it a lot. The strong empty circles for eyes, the use of pure black in a lot of locations and the many many lines to imply feathers.</p>
<p>Artists, please all put your name in the piece itself so I can find you through the terrible Pinterest pipeline.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/wap-14.4.2-3802be43dc8f7e2755372e26079e133f.jpg" width="3000" height="2000" class="img_ev3q"></p>

<p>I put these two together as both are explorations of doing a characterised face for a hawk. These were fun to analyse and see what really comes into play to convey emotion on a face that in reality doesn’t really move much.</p>

<p>I was possibly over confident going into this day 5. I felt pretty comfortable with hawks. However I’ve been rushing through the last weeks and I’m unhappy with the product. I’d really like to spend more time on pieces instead of trying to get something out in 20 minutes.</p>

<p>I was happy to spend some time looking at hawks. When I started this week I was going to spend some time pointing out the differences between hawks and falcons but Pinterest is so unreliable that I’m even questioning what I know. Maybe if I do falcons for a future week.</p>
<p>I am starting to re-think my practice approach as I feel like I haven’t been doing it in a very focused way. Feeling more like I’m just forcing myself through the steps and not being conscious of takeaways from each day.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[Week 13 - Figure skaters]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week was my first week at trying to do some focused anatomy and human poses. For references I went with figure skaters as they do some pretty weird stuff with their body that you don’t see people doing in other situations.</p>
<p>Which, surprise surprise, does make it more difficult.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="day-1---drawing-from-imagination">Day 1 - Drawing from imagination<a href="https://kymira.ca/blog/wap-13#day-1---drawing-from-imagination" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Day 1 - Drawing from imagination" title="Direct link to Day 1 - Drawing from imagination">​</a></h2>
<p>I enjoyed watching figure skating when I had cable. But not enough to go out of my way to watch it now. So my memories of the movements are a little rusty going into day 1.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/wap-13.1-4cf010f8e922e0fff1db221e70474073.jpg" width="3072" height="1861" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="day-2---figure-sketching">Day 2 - Figure sketching<a href="https://kymira.ca/blog/wap-13#day-2---figure-sketching" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Day 2 - Figure sketching" title="Direct link to Day 2 - Figure sketching">​</a></h2>
<p>Competitive figure skating is highly photographed so there is an endless supply of reference photos for the sport. However as I started to gather references I did come to realise that Yuri on Ice has taken over a large part of figure skating fandom, especially the art side.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Quick sketches using references" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/wap-13.2-8dd1b9d79a4c78f81f559dd2f86eedb2.jpg" width="3072" height="1794" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="day-3---reference-studies">Day 3 - Reference studies<a href="https://kymira.ca/blog/wap-13#day-3---reference-studies" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Day 3 - Reference studies" title="Direct link to Day 3 - Reference studies">​</a></h2>
<p>Since I’m more focused on the body and not so much the whole scene of figure skating I did only want to focus on the physical pose for my reference studies. So this meant no drawing fancy figure skating outfits or hair styles.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/wap-13.3.1-b9fc435cd72d4926f6200541dcd32850.jpg" width="3000" height="2000" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/wap-13.3.2-1a3082249d605ab736cde350682e475e.jpg" width="3000" height="2000" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>By this day I was thinking that I should pull up some lessons on different figure drawing approaches. Some people have some lovely styled ways of doing figure drawing while others have some extremely detailed shapes that they use to really analyse the pose. My own approach is a bit of a mishmash of the styles I learned last year which I don’t feel like is either super stylized or super accurate. So in my next anatomy focused week I think I want to find a more refined approach.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="day-4---style-studies">Day 4 - Style studies<a href="https://kymira.ca/blog/wap-13#day-4---style-studies" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Day 4 - Style studies" title="Direct link to Day 4 - Style studies">​</a></h2>
<p>Trying to find art of figure skaters is where the Yuri on Ice characters dominate. I didn’t want to pull directly from anime which led to having to restrict my choices a bit. I found someone else basically doing the thing I’m trying to do, figure skater pose sketches:</p>

<p>After doing these few I kind of wish I had just used a bunch of Yuri on Ice references and decided to go for an anime style fully instead of just the one piece.</p>

<p>Due to my procrastinating I did day 4 and day 5 on the same day. This maybe gives some advantage to day 5, even just on the level of being warmed up before starting.</p>
<p>Instead of doing multiple takes I decided to take the first pose that came to mind and went through a few fixing stages. Extend a few limbs, keep having to make the head bigger. Just fixes to try to get the anatomy closer and closer to correct.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/wap-13.5-af21e0fa2a071a57a6c05acefce33db1.jpg" width="3000" height="2000" class="img_ev3q"></p>

<p>While I was procrastinating on doing my studies I did a watercolor practice instead. I save Youtube tutorials as they pop up if they look interesting and within my skill level so this is the one I followed this week.</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NjuMrThyWU8?si=NODYS9sZN7zVAlZt" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin"></iframe>
<p>This took about 30 minutes which made for a nice quick dip back into watercolours. I haven’t touched them much since last summer, it just doesn’t feel like a winter medium for art.</p>

<p>I kind of regret choosing figure skaters as my subject matter for my first anatomy week. They have so many weird poses and there is constant foreshortening or hidden parts of the body in the photos. My girlfriend says this makes for a good challenge but it definitely led to me dragging my feet on doing simple studies because of how messed up looking they were coming out.</p>
<p>But I do think it sets a good benchmark. If I was a master of anatomy I would be able to piece together what the body is doing in the areas I can’t see. I didn’t feel super confident in the guesses I made in these but it will be a good sign of improvement later on when I feel like I can make those conclusions.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As mentioned in my last WAP, I’ve made a return to creature drawing to have some easier WAP weeks. I’m not sure how I got the idea for anteaters, possibly Pinterest simply showed me an image of one and I went “whoa strange dog.”</p>
<p>I also tried out a new practice method that I learned from a YouTube video this week. It… didn’t go great.</p>

<p>I had just put together my Pinterest board the day before so giant anteaters were fresh on my mind when I went into day 1.</p>

<p>Day 1 here felt like one of my best day ones so far. At least for accuracy. The main error being how I did the ears. Day two saw some improvements for anatomy. But it was also here that I started to notice that there aren’t that many different images of giant anteaters. Like, I couldn’t find more than one or two of them lying down. None just sitting.</p>

<p>Spending more time on day 3 meant paying a little more attention to their colouration patterns. Which is mostly that big black triangle.</p>

<p>Style studies are still my favourite for animal weeks. I tried to move from more realistic to more simplistic.</p>

<p>Remembering my problem with movement from previous animal challenges, I spent some time before doing my day 5 test watching videos of giant anteaters. YouTube didn’t have a great collection of these. But enough that I finally got to see their front feet in action. It wasn’t until day 5 that I learnt that giant anteaters walk on their knuckles (like gorillas) to protect their very sharp and huge front claws.</p>
<p>Also learned that they fight back against jaguars by using those large claws and standing up on their back legs, using their huge tail as a kind of tripod support to stay upright. So I tried drawing this upright position even though I never saw an image of them taking this pose.</p>

<p>Every now and then YouTube will recommend a decent art tutorial video. I’m always on the hunt for things like guided practice and different ways to study so this one got my attention.</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AB9yTNfE3go?si=9xy_U650xEzygCeK" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin"></iframe>
<p>I liked the sound of this approach because it’s similar to how I would practise for exams. Making flash cards, going through the movements of questions and answers. I also liked the idea of giving yourself just an hour to do it.</p>
<p>My study subject for my first attempt is this <a href="https://www.artstation.com/artwork/GGNw4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">drow piece by Anna Siwoń</a>. I like the grumpy expression so that’s what I wanted to focus on.</p>
<p>The idea is to first draw the image while looking at it. Then take the reference away and try to do it again. Make corrections, spot where you went wrong. Then hide the reference again and try again.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/blindstudy1-24430bad6b4502ff7a839279d9ba685a.jpg" width="1307" height="955" class="img_ev3q"></p>

<p>I honestly felt like I was getting worse and worse as the attempts went on. So I’m not sure how I feel about this just yet. I should probably try with either a smaller focus or on something more generic. I’m not sure yet.</p>

<p>I felt like I got a decent amount of practice time in this week. The anteaters didn’t take very long each day. Finally feels like getting back in the grove after Renpy month. Main downside being that anteaters are so unique and weird I’m not sure when learning their shape is going to be helpful again. Maybe in monster creation or something like that.</p>
<p>I hope to try to blind practice method again but I’m having my doubts. There are other approaches for learning other artists styles which I might try out instead. Compare the methods and see which one works best for me.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[Week 10 - Books and shelves]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This was a messy WAP week. <a href="https://www.danarama.ca/Blog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dana</a> suggested fancy books so I gave that a shot, but turns out inanimate objects just aren’t that interesting. Reminding me why I so rarely do still life pieces.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="day-1---drawing-from-imagination">Day 1 - Drawing from imagination<a href="https://kymira.ca/blog/wap-11#day-1---drawing-from-imagination" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Day 1 - Drawing from imagination" title="Direct link to Day 1 - Drawing from imagination">​</a></h2>
<p>When it comes down to it, books are just squares. So it was pretty easy to quickly draw some squares.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/wap-11.1-d0a553574f46c550e6af4fc6ebea09dc.jpg" width="3055" height="1912" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="day-2---figure-sketching">Day 2 - Figure sketching<a href="https://kymira.ca/blog/wap-11#day-2---figure-sketching" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Day 2 - Figure sketching" title="Direct link to Day 2 - Figure sketching">​</a></h2>
<p>On day 2 I started to recognize an early hangup of this subject. Since books are basically just squares I’d much rather draw them digitally using square or line making tools for consistency. But doing any sort of intricate design on the cover, something that’s often requiring small, repetitive motions, is something I’d rather do with traditional media. I wanted to get better at drawing straight lines so I didn’t even end up letting myself use the square or line tools for day 2. So these came out rather messy and not detailed.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Quick sketches using references" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/wap-11.2-55a0261e74f256559aa38bd6642062f7.jpg" width="2000" height="2000" class="img_ev3q"></p>

<p>Tried to force myself into doing more time on these but I just don’t have the patience for doing detailed designs. So I swapped to doing more book themed scenes. Which are more engaging but the idea of drawing 100 books in a scene is a really big turn off.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/wap-11.3-acf159dfe7cb33c0d5bbb43506b7f99c.jpg" width="1001" height="1463" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>I ended up spending more time trying to find a brush that would give me irregular squares to quickly fill shelves. I didn’t find exactly what I wanted in Clip Studio so kind of just moved on.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="day-4---style-studies">Day 4 - Style studies<a href="https://kymira.ca/blog/wap-11#day-4---style-studies" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Day 4 - Style studies" title="Direct link to Day 4 - Style studies">​</a></h2>
<p>For the style study I decided to do a scene study. Just wanted to try blocking in the shapes and creating a scene. I’m once again worried that this might be an AI piece, the one clue being “wtf is up with these hanging lights? Are they inside or outside? Is that pumpkin on the right attached to the tree?”</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/wap-11.4-aed9d9123d89de0960fc713aed48ac67.jpg" width="2476" height="1976" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>I was actually kind of happy with the stylized look of the building in the end, but got tired by the time I should start filling out the inside of the building so I just rushed through with the bare minimum.</p>

<p>I really wasn’t sure what to do for drawing from imagination day since I struggled to find any main take away lessons from the practice days. I decided to go for drawing the bookshelf that was next to me. Which happens to actually not be many books.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/wap-11.5-b8b458f68b45910837e895503803c8d8.jpg" width="1060" height="2052" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>It was still pretty painful to draw the books that were there. Was mostly hype about doing the skull. I was originally going to go into more details but the weekend quickly disappeared so just tried to push through to get the space filled.</p>

<p>Another week I didn’t find particularly inspiring. Trying to do too much and too little at the same time.</p>
<p>I’m probably going to go back to animals for a bit to re-find my groove with these weekly practices. Then every few weeks I’m going to try to focus on human anatomy and movement since I know it’s such a key area if I want to get comfortable drawing characters again.</p>
<p>This week I also found a YouTube video explaining a blind study method for art that got my attention because it’s similar to how I would study for school. It’s a practice that you should put at least an hour aside to do so I’m going to try to find time to do it at least once next week between whatever animal I end up choosing.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[Week 10 - Sword swing]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WAP is back.</p>
<p>It was hard to get back into this practice style after a month away. I kind of forgot the physical steps of it and had to remind myself of what the days were for. Maybe it didn’t help that my returning subject was a more difficult one: Swinging swords.</p>
<p>I had wanted to do something a little more dynamic pose wise. But it one where anatomy is so important that without a really good grasp of the photo body references, doing style studies feels extra challenging as I’m not 100% sure what’s correct.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="day-1---drawing-from-imagination">Day 1 - Drawing from imagination<a href="https://kymira.ca/blog/wap-10#day-1---drawing-from-imagination" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Day 1 - Drawing from imagination" title="Direct link to Day 1 - Drawing from imagination">​</a></h2>
<p>Feeling rusty that’s for sure. Dynamic poses without a reference are up there on the difficulty scale so there are just so many bad proportions here. I was feeling pretty done with it after just doing 3 half bodies but I think pushing myself to fill the page helped a lot to go beyond my comfort zone.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/wap-10.1-267c2a2c1c0613af6a34ecfa7004f392.jpg" width="3020" height="1882" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="day-2---figure-sketching">Day 2 - Figure sketching<a href="https://kymira.ca/blog/wap-10#day-2---figure-sketching" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Day 2 - Figure sketching" title="Direct link to Day 2 - Figure sketching">​</a></h2>
<p>I ended up doing way more pages of day 2 than usual. I have wanted to up the speed in which these speed studies are done and I found that action poses take up a fair bit of room on the page.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Quick sketches using references" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/wap-10.2.1-979dcab046c8ed50531973335d59ca86.jpg" width="3040" height="1870" class="img_ev3q">

<p>It was harder than I thought it would be to find photographs of sword fighting action. Lots of fencing, some historical style with samurai swords, but not too much else. Found one or two shots of actors learning some choreography, but definitely expected more LARP-like content. But I also was trying to focus on what looked professional so that the people in the photos had proper form. But given I don’t know what proper form looks like it’s not something I should realistically be trying to judge.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="day-3---reference-studies">Day 3 - Reference studies<a href="https://kymira.ca/blog/wap-10#day-3---reference-studies" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Day 3 - Reference studies" title="Direct link to Day 3 - Reference studies">​</a></h2>
<p>While working on these I started to consider a good practice approach to be choosing one pose and trying to draw it from multiple angles. Just to pursue trying to understand the pose and not just ignoring anything that the limbs or the weapon hide from view. I didn’t end up doing that because I wanted to try out a variety of poses. But if I revisit the subject I might give it a shot.</p>

<p>I didn’t feel like I had any really solid discoveries or moments of enlightenment from working from this style studies. A lot comes back to having a good grasp of anatomy and understanding how the body moves. I didn’t notice that one of the arms in the Solo Leveling reference was pretty messed up which then made me question the pose overall. But given that it’s a screenshot it’s not like it’s an image that was meant to be overly scrutinised. What seems more important is being able to “sell” the movement.</p>

<p>I possibly made the mistake of waiting 3 days to do the final test day. Felt like the knowledge had already left my head.</p>

<p>I can’t say I loved this week. It was difficult and nothing was really coming out as I hoped. It’s been a while since I’ve done a full body pose and it shows. Really thinking that what I should be doing is spending a week every month on figure drawing just to get confident in human bodies again.</p>
<p>If I can find some good references I’d like to try again as weapon poses are very much what I’d like to be doing with D&amp;D art but it feels like there are lots of pieces to master before pulling off dynamic poses.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>My approach to March was to put my Weekly Art Practice on hold while participating in NaNoRenO in an attempt to really push my art skills into focusing on scenes and backgrounds. I felt like I started off pretty strong on this mission but at this point in the month I know it’s not gonna happen.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="nanoreno">NaNoRenO<a href="https://kymira.ca/blog/march-wrap-up#nanoreno" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to NaNoRenO" title="Direct link to NaNoRenO">​</a></h2>
<p>While I spat out over 8 different backgrounds in 2 weeks, when I went to switch into writing mode I wasn’t really feeling the project any more. I have most of the ideas fleshed out but I don’t love it. I also don’t get the same creative hit from writing as I do from working on visual art.</p>
<p>I did enjoy troubleshooting the Ren’py setup though. I was able to get randomised scene selection working with modatory scenes in between. If I were to do the project again I would probably try to team up with a writer instead of trying to tackle it all on my own. For this project my girlfriend says she’s tempted to take a shot at doing the writing so maybe it will turn into a game in the end.</p>
<p>One thing I learned about taking on a month-long project was that it was a great way to trigger my procrastination instincts. I finished 2 whole games this month, one of which I had been putting off for ages. The Return of Obra Dinn (which only took 2 days) and Tears of the Kingdom, which it turns out I was only about 15 hours from the end when I put it down months ago. So now I know that if I want to finish some other things all I need to do is give myself a big project to avoid.</p>
<p>I did do one last piece for the project last week. The only character who makes an appearance, a fisherman who stops by the lighthouse to give the main character supplies.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="A fisherman wearing blue-grey overalls, a beige sweater and a green knit hat." src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/sl-fisherman-fea86689b7dda0cc0c11ee866c546c67.png" width="837" height="1360" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>The vibe for the game that I wanted to aim for was everything seems to be fine, this is like learning what a day in the life of a lighthouse keeper is. But with a pretty quick reveal that something isn’t right. Minor hints of this were going to be added to the background pieces but I think there’s only one visible now. This led to the choice to keep the kind of dead, beady eyes my fisherman sketch had in the final product. I wanted him to also look a little off.</p>
<p>All in all the first two weeks were a great crash course in doing completed scenes. But I quickly started to miss my weekly art practice. Having clear goals every day really helps with focus and a sense of accomplishment. The variety and change up every week helps too, so it felt almost odd to focus on a single project for a whole month.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="a-different-kind-of-scene">A different kind of scene<a href="https://kymira.ca/blog/march-wrap-up#a-different-kind-of-scene" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to A different kind of scene" title="Direct link to A different kind of scene">​</a></h2>
<p>Since I kind of “ran out” of pieces to work on for the Ren'py project but didn’t want to resume weekly art practice yet I started a new, very large piece. It’s not large in pixels but it does feel large in ambition. This is what I have so far:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="A 3 story pink stone building. Two balconies above a shop front that hasn’t been drawn in yet." src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/dragon-flowers-wip-67e4267b2e6026bb69fbc0bb4b100fe9.jpg" width="1057" height="2000" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>My Ren’py work did make me more comfortable with scenes and trying out new styles. I wanted to work on something similar but with references that would help a scene be recognizable. A challenge to make a piece that could still resemble the references. So this is a representation of Dragon Flowers, a famous Montreal flower shop. Or at least it’s old location. The store has had a rough few years.</p>
<p>I started with the upper balconies, trying to focus on smaller segments to not feel too overwhelmed. Dragon Flowers always has a lot of stuff outside the shop, and I honestly find it rather chaotic. But it’s what makes it an interesting challenge. My goal will be to work on it when I still feel like drawing after doing my daily WAP goals.</p>

<p>While I’m not ending the month with a completed game as I had planned, the amount of time I spent in Clip Studio, trying out new brushes, doing research into lighting and scenes did lead to a lot of learning. I actually even enjoyed working on all the scenes. I do still wish I could find a consistent style (I’m constantly agonising over what kind of brush I should use for inking, how big should it be???). But overall I don’t think the pieces I did this month vary too wildly from one another.</p>
<p>Next month I’m going to get back into regular practice and blogging.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[Week 2 progress overview]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Week 2 has been a rather slow one. The time change hit me really hard so I felt a little ill the first few days just from my sleep getting messed with. Then my other projects and volunteer work took up a fair bit of space on other days. And today I’m off to get a tattoo which likely won’t leave me in a “go make art” kind of mood after either. So we’re in challenging times!</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="backgrounds">Backgrounds<a href="https://kymira.ca/blog/nanoreno2#backgrounds" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Backgrounds" title="Direct link to Backgrounds">​</a></h2>
<p>While I only did two backgrounds this week I am rather happy with them. The first was this big storm scene. I did some research into painting storm clouds and then also into waves (which I often find difficult). The lightning looks rather unnatural due to being from a lightning brush but I kind of like how much it stands out as it is the focus of the pieces.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Top of a lighthouse looking out at rough waves. A large bolt of lightning moves between storm clouds." src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/sl-storm-bg-0cd4ae14d8b8a855e5fe4fbb0d883b14.jpg" width="1920" height="1080" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>The second background has a lot of simple cheats for doing woodsy backdrops but it takes a lot of time to fill all the layers this kind of piece needs. So I spent two evenings chipping away at this one. But I feel like the shading does pull things together and convey depth in the scene. I could probably make it even stronger by doing more obvious lighting but I was starting to feel like I needed to move on… to resting on the couch and watching tv.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Stag on a path in the woods." src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/sl-forest-bg-ab1c6ec7c42d36def3ca5b04b7cee573.jpg" width="1920" height="1080" class="img_ev3q"></p>

<p>This is such a small website change that I suspect no one would notice unless I point it out. But I started using my own favicon to replace the default Docusaurus one (even though I do love the Docusaurus dinosaur). It’s now this guy, which was an attempt at making a 16x16px squirrel for a possible GameBoy game but I think it looks a little more dog-like? But at least some sort of creature-like but I like that it might not be obvious.</p>

<p>This coming week I’m going to try to start working on writing. I’m a little uncertain about this as I’m pulled to do most of my writing in Google Docs as that’s where most of my work lives but due to the formatting of things it will probably be easiest to work in the text editor that I use to open the Ren’py code files.</p>
<p>I find myself already missing my weekly art practice as it was so much easier to only to commit to things for 1 week at a time.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[Progress in my first week of participating in NaNoRenO]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Week 1 of NaNoRenO is over, so time for a re-cap of what I could get through this week. This will definitely contain spoilers, I guess?? But also the game is completely in flux so who knows what a real spoiler is.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="renpy">Ren’py<a href="https://kymira.ca/blog/nanoreno1#renpy" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Ren’py" title="Direct link to Ren’py">​</a></h2>
<p>My biggest game “mechanic” that I wanted to be able to incorporate was randomising the order of scenes a player could get. It ended up being easy enough to find other people asking for example how to do this. So I took some code samples shared in a forum and started to experiment with how to use it. So far so good, now I just need to not get lost in it while filling in the content.</p>
<p>Something I don’t love about Ren’py is that it seems like the bulk of the game is in a single file. It will probably make it easier to hunt for errors in the future but I’m very worried about how messy the file will get.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="backgrounds">Backgrounds<a href="https://kymira.ca/blog/nanoreno1#backgrounds" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Backgrounds" title="Direct link to Backgrounds">​</a></h2>
<p>My main focus for the week was backgrounds. With the second day being troubleshooting why my image isn't filling the screen properly. Spent a fair bit of time researching why this could happen only to finally find that it was my own Clip Studio Paint save setting that was re-sizing the output. Oops. Which is why at the end of day one this was all the progress I had to show.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Quick sketches using references" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/day1-9690de712c4ebb62d9e37ed498b55b1a.png" width="1718" height="993" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>With that solved I spent each day trying to complete one background. As of today I have 6, having taken 2 days easy after longer work days. So I’m pretty happy about that. It’s nearly 50% of the backgrounds I had planned for.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="A collection of 5 background images." src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/week1-bgs-2d0d5a96a1860282b11b8cec2ea669bf.jpg" width="1600" height="1300" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="planning">Planning<a href="https://kymira.ca/blog/nanoreno1#planning" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Planning" title="Direct link to Planning">​</a></h2>
<p>I had done my original game flow layout before the month started (which you are allowed to do!). I had originally planned to make the first prototype of this game in Twine so I had that downloaded and ready to go. I’m more familiar with Twine so I used it to lay down the main beats/scenes as well as the progression path. Which resulted in this:</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Screenshot of Twine boxes" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/scene-flow-18030958df0a3a9ad94993d405d7ef75.png" width="1390" height="1042" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>This is what helped me count how many backgrounds I would need and how many scenes I would have to write.</p>
<p>I’ve only written a few lines so far, I should really start getting other ideas down. But I have confidence in my writing speed and less confidence in my drawing speed so the creation of the assets is my biggest priority while I still have new project excitement.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="conclusion">Conclusion<a href="https://kymira.ca/blog/nanoreno1#conclusion" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Conclusion" title="Direct link to Conclusion">​</a></h2>
<p>I do feel my desire for drawing backgrounds already waning. But buying new brushes and finding ways to “cheat” a look I want to do still feels nice. In some places, like the fence in the garden scene, I tried to find a fence brush that would help me spit that out in a second. But after trying 3 or 4 I gave up and drew one segment then repeated it. For the ropes in the outdoor lighthouse scene that was an easy brush to find so I could just do 2 lines then done. So there is a bit of a treasure hunt quality to some of the tasks which I enjoy. Found a water reflection brush that I feel like works really well so I’m no longer afraid to fill the space on large bodies of water.</p>
<p>The indoor scenes though, yikes.</p>
<p>I did a fair bit of research into lighthouses before I started (and still am really). But there are very few images of the inside of lighthouses. And these days when you try to research them, what you’re going to find is remodelled lighthouses turned into Air B&amp;Bs. Which is very much not what I’m looking for.</p>
<p>So with indoor scenes being a weakness and having basically zero reference images to work from, I’m afraid these rooms are going to look rather wild as I continue to draw more of them. I’m proud of the desk scene at least. That’s the first image in the game so I wanted to at least not hate it. While a few of the backgrounds I’ve done I do hate already. But we only have a month so can’t dwell on trying to fix them, it’s on to the next image.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[Week 9 - Trees]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Spending a week on trees is kind of a weird one. It’s pretty rare that I would want to draw a singular tree, more often I’d be wanting to draw a forest as part of a landscape or some simple background shapes where the tree isn’t one of the pain focal points. But I still wanted to do this week to spend time looking at West Coast trees and try to find ways to quickly construct trees that I could possibly re-use for the NaNoRenO project.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="day-1---drawing-from-imagination">Day 1 - Drawing from imagination<a href="https://kymira.ca/blog/wap-9#day-1---drawing-from-imagination" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Day 1 - Drawing from imagination" title="Direct link to Day 1 - Drawing from imagination">​</a></h2>
<p>It’s pretty easy to mentally bring up an image of a tree, but even my mental image of a tree is way more simplified than what a tree actually looks like. It’s easy to think of triangle pin trees, or apple trees that are mostly just a green circle for the leaves and then a trunk. Trying to be realistic mostly feels like drawing leaves and branches until you get tired of it.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/wap-9.1-be09459b9375e1293427784130d96c84.jpg" width="2265" height="1218" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>I did take a stab at some non-local tree types that were in my head from preparing my reference photos the day before. There are some very interesting trees out there.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="day-2---figure-sketching">Day 2 - Figure sketching<a href="https://kymira.ca/blog/wap-9#day-2---figure-sketching" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Day 2 - Figure sketching" title="Direct link to Day 2 - Figure sketching">​</a></h2>
<p>Tried to make myself speed up for figure sketching this week. It worked for the first three, mostly just laying down shapes. After that I spent more time thinking about the smaller parts of the tree and wanting to give them more detail as the first 3 felt like messy blobs.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Quick sketches using references" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/wap-9.2-2127aef8068c95dfabf690327fd33d61.jpg" width="1941" height="1386" class="img_ev3q"></p>

<p>It was a little strange to do reference studies since I know my goal for the end of the week isn’t to replicate trees exactly. At this point I started to play around with brushes to lay down leaves faster, using the reference mostly for shape.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/wap-9.3-a8fb03e89c19cd10347ea006262d8b53.jpg" width="3072" height="1728" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>I did multiple pine trees because I knew I’d be drawing a lot of them in March. These were pretty simple in that I just tried out 3 different brushes to act as the pine needles. Then on the more detailed one I just tried hand drawing a bunch of branches. Which didn’t actually take too long in the end.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="day-4---style-studies">Day 4 - Style studies<a href="https://kymira.ca/blog/wap-9#day-4---style-studies" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Day 4 - Style studies" title="Direct link to Day 4 - Style studies">​</a></h2>
<p>There were a lot of different styles I wanted to spend time on but it could have been a project for the whole week. First I tried some of the vector styles that I had tried a bit when doing lighthouses &amp; landscape week. And then a more cartoon-y style that I like a lot for it’s flow.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/wap-9.4.1-e8c5ff7d1fd983da37b6901c7be1bbf1.jpg" width="3072" height="1728" class="img_ev3q"></p>

<p>Then I tried for some watercolours but remembered the watercolour brushes I like are on Procreate and not in Clip. So I don’t feel like I was able to really re-create the right style there. But I like the originals and may pursue them on paper someday.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/wap-9.4.2-33a9658608b4d571d7a4ac0a1144f9be.jpg" width="3072" height="1728" class="img_ev3q"></p>

<p>Then I wanted to do a more painterly one. I liked how blocky this one was and used some new square brushes that I was finally able to find. Pretty happy with this vibe but don’t feel like it’s a great fit for trying to draw a whole forest.</p>

<p>There were a lot of tree styles I liked so I attempted to do a variety of them from memory. The vector type, the take it slow type, and a block-y painting type.</p>

<p>I don’t feel like I have strong takeaways from this week except for the new found curiosity to keep exploring other styles. I wasn’t expecting trees to have so much variety but I guess since they are one of the most common elements to a nature scene they are re-produced constantly. So I can see re-visiting trees in the future as there are more on my Pinterest board I’d like to experiment with.</p>
<p>With NaNoRenO starting today I’m thinking of putting my Weekly Art Practice work on pause while I focus on all the art pieces needed for the VN. Got a few scene sketches started today, a meer fraction of the work ahead for the planned project. But I’ll probably keep to weekly blogging just with sharing game progress instead of practice progress.</p>
