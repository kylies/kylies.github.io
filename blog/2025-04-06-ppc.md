This week started off as a reference study. I had my 3 references selected, got through some thumbnails, did some different colour compositions and even started painting.

But then there was a joke; What if Pink Pony Club, but it’s Pawmi instead of Pony. As context, a Pawmi is a recent gen Pokemon. This is a Pawmi:

The next day I went to see what colour shiny Pawmis are, and well, they’re pink. The joke basically writes itself. So I paused my reference study and drew Pawmis for a few days.

## Chappell Roan’s Pink Pony Club

The first step to working on this visual gag was to actually watch the music video for Chappell Roan’s Pink Pony Club. I’ve known the song for a few years now but I’m not in the habit of watching music videos. Overall I found it to be pretty underwhelming, I was hoping for more over the top visuals to work with.

## Early sketches

After choosing the stage from the video as the main scene I started to do some sketches in Procreate. At first I had envisioned one of each Pawmi evolution on stage so I did two passes at that to find a composition. I ended up with two Pawmos that I really liked (Pawmis middle evolution) so I ended up keeping four of the sketches on stage.

## Rendering

I didn’t want to do the lines on the iPad so I sent the file over to my laptop and continued the piece in CSP. I wasn’t certain how I wanted to render the piece but I knew I wanted to keep it simple and at least close to the Pokemon style. I ended up really liking my first pass which was using the ink style from my Hades study week, using a pen with a set size. So 7px for the exterior lines and get smaller as you go inwards. I’ve just come to like its consistency and not worrying about how hard I’m pressing while trying to focus on getting the right lines down.

Took a break after that guy and continued the next day. Which happened to be my birthday where I was gifted two Pokemon for keeping company at my art desk. Gender is a drawing support who I now put between me and the desk to stop me from hunching forward too much while drawing at the tablet. And Pawmot is there because I love him.

The full render took about 3 days of working on it here and there and it came together pretty easily. My wife suggested that there should be some cowboy accessories so I did give them some rhinestone garments. I didn’t want to spend ages on the background because this piece was mostly done to just show a joke but I feel like it sells pretty well for a simple background.

## Conclusion

I had a lot of fun with this piece. It’s easy to keep working on something when just looking at it makes you happy. I got to search and look at a lot of pawmi images. What more could a girl want?

Since I like looking at my guys so much I did then return and make a vertical format so that I could possibly use them as a phone background to see them every day. I’ll now try to return to my reference study, maybe give it a few extra days while I try to learn some digital oil painting techniques.
