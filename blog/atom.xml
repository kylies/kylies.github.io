        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It’s time for another anatomy week. This week I went with volleyball poses. I played a lot of volleyball between the ages of ~14-18 so I’m pretty familiar with the sport, but it has been a long time since I’ve seen any volleyball in action.</p>

<p>I didn’t hate these sketches after doing them which is a pretty rare day 1 feeling.</p>

<p>There’s plenty of volleyball photography out there, and some really good action poses since there’s a lot of quick movements during a game.</p>

<p>Each day feels like it's getting a little cleaner.</p>

<p>People have done some really dramatic angles in their volleyball poses. I still rarely play around with perspective, especially with the anatomy weeks since I still want to get more consistent at proportions but also foreshortening.</p>

<p>I didn’t push too much outside my comfort zone with this one but I did try to do an aerial angle on one. I can now see that the head is off angle but overall it feels like a small baby step to playing with perspective more.</p>

<p>On top of my weekly practice I also did a colour study this week. A common practice method I’ve been wanting to do more is to try from movie stills. Movies are heavily invested in lighting and composition so learning from movies you like is a good way to learn.</p>
<p>I did direct colour picks from this still from The Fall, one of my favourite movies. The whole movie is rather muted but the characters themselves often have a very vibrant colour as part of their outfit. I really like this bright red and gold outfit in this scene of beautiful stucco structures. Next time I’ll try choosing the colours manually instead of colour picking them with the eye drop tool to see if I can guess the colours because when using the eye drop I’m often surprised by how much darker or lighter a colour is once I see it on the colour wheel.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This week I went for hyenas. They’ve always been pretty cool and feel like another “weird dog” type. But surprise surprise, I actually learned a lot about hyenas this week. First one being, they aren’t that closely related to dogs. Instead they are closer to the cat family but their closest animal relative is actually the meerkat.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_FNw8" id="day-1---drawing-from-imagination">Day 1 - Drawing from imagination<a href="https://kymira.ca/blog/wap-16#day-1---drawing-from-imagination" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Day 1 - Drawing from imagination" title="Direct link to Day 1 - Drawing from imagination">​</a></h2>
<p>I was very over confident on day 1. It disappeared as soon as I started sketching. Very much a ‘head empty’ kind of day where I feel like I did just draw some weird dogs. Can’t even say these are recognizably hyenas.</p>

<p>A little better with references. But already I’m feeling like this animal is a challenge. Its shapes are un-intuitive to me.</p>

<p>One of my goals with hyenas was to avoid having only Lion King art for reference. Which actually didn’t turn out to be that hard. People love to draw hyenas, possibly because their faces are so expressive.</p>

<p>The fun facts about hyena’s I learned came from this <a href="https://www.pinterest.ca/pin/598978819224783588/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">anatomy study by BitterSweetDisease on Deviantart</a>. However I’m not the first person to go searching for their account. I found a forum of someone else trying to find their original stuff saying the account has been deactivated. Which is unfortunate because the pieces that have made it to Pinterest are well done.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I’m two weeks behind on blog posts so I’m gonna keep these two rather short to get them out. This week was another childhood animal revisit: Penguins.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/kid-penguin-32af8256922f836c78ec9b50541e9988.jpg" width="840" height="1325" class="img_wQsy"></p>

<p>Penguins were honestly pretty easy from the get go. They have a pretty iconic yet simple shape. However, non of these day one guys are any specific species of penguin and are more just my mental model for what a penguin is.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/wap-15.1-9c7a26c6035a901c5ff3976abe0a1d6e.jpg" width="3011" height="1825" class="img_wQsy"></p>

<p>I did struggle with movement on day 1. Other than walk around, stand around, and swim, what to penguins do? I had forgotten about how more active they could look when moving about.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Quick hand sketches using references" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/wap-15.2-b00d6d8e2a90d9df733844ce7f6b0849.jpg" width="2918" height="1824" class="img_wQsy"></p>

<p>By this day I’m starting to wonder if I should have chosen a specific species to focus on as there is a fair bit of variety between different penguins.</p>

<p>I made a mistake here in that a lot of the styled images are baby penguins. Very cute but I hadn’t meant for that to become the focus.</p>

<p>This is one of the first times where I feel like there is almost zero change from day 1 to day 5. Partially due to the lack of pose options and partially because I really rushed through this day 5. I’m not sure if I should force myself to get day 5 done in a sloppy way or if not even doing it is better as I’m unlikely to learn anything if I just force something on paper without giving it conscious thought.</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Week 14 - Hawks]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Some of my upcoming animal week themes are based on photos of artwork from my childhood that my mom has been sending me. This week comes from this ink hawk I did when I was 14. Started to get into calligraphy pens and ink in general. Honestly, this is something I don’t cringe at and I think I would struggle to recreate today.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/wap-14.0-6ff0e1953b62ca2260e7d80a39557d5d.jpg" width="1200" height="1600" class="img_wQsy"></p>

<p>I spent a lot of time drawing birds when I was young, especially birds of prey. They were a big favourite of mine.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/wap-14.1-cbf82bd01a21d25b85dd1b892077cf7d.png" width="3024" height="1805" class="img_wQsy"></p>

<p>It felt easy enough to get into draw hawks again with a reference. Nearly all my references are red-tailed hawks due to the algorithm.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Quick hand sketches using references" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/wap-14.2-8d19779149cb196fd2c9a0221a713a22.jpg" width="3072" height="1890" class="img_wQsy"></p>

<p>I think I’ve been rushing my reference studies the last few weeks. I have been feeling very pressed for time, or at least time where I have creative energy. After that blind study video I’m thinking I should prioritise writing down a list of my main takeaways after doing the studies. As I find I’m ending up on day 5 and don’t have a foundation to work up from.</p>

<p>There are a fair bit of stylized hawks out there but I did have a hard time finding some that I really liked. This first one feels like a pretty forward flat cartoon style.</p>

<p>This piece got my attention pretty quickly. It’s way more stylized than anything I do but I like it a lot. The strong empty circles for eyes, the use of pure black in a lot of locations and the many many lines to imply feathers.</p>
<p>Artists, please all put your name in the piece itself so I can find you through the terrible Pinterest pipeline.</p>

<p>I put these two together as both are explorations of doing a characterised face for a hawk. These were fun to analyse and see what really comes into play to convey emotion on a face that in reality doesn’t really move much.</p>

<p>I was possibly over confident going into this day 5. I felt pretty comfortable with hawks. However I’ve been rushing through the last weeks and I’m unhappy with the product. I’d really like to spend more time on pieces instead of trying to get something out in 20 minutes.</p>

<p>I was happy to spend some time looking at hawks. When I started this week I was going to spend some time pointing out the differences between hawks and falcons but Pinterest is so unreliable that I’m even questioning what I know. Maybe if I do falcons for a future week.</p>
<p>I am starting to re-think my practice approach as I feel like I haven’t been doing it in a very focused way. Feeling more like I’m just forcing myself through the steps and not being conscious of takeaways from each day.</p>]]></content>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Week 13 - Figure skaters]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This week was my first week at trying to do some focused anatomy and human poses. For references I went with figure skaters as they do some pretty weird stuff with their body that you don’t see people doing in other situations.</p>
<p>Which, surprise surprise, does make it more difficult.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_FNw8" id="day-1---drawing-from-imagination">Day 1 - Drawing from imagination<a href="https://kymira.ca/blog/wap-13#day-1---drawing-from-imagination" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Day 1 - Drawing from imagination" title="Direct link to Day 1 - Drawing from imagination">​</a></h2>
<p>I enjoyed watching figure skating when I had cable. But not enough to go out of my way to watch it now. So my memories of the movements are a little rusty going into day 1.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/wap-13.1-4cf010f8e922e0fff1db221e70474073.jpg" width="3072" height="1861" class="img_wQsy"></p>

<p>Competitive figure skating is highly photographed so there is an endless supply of reference photos for the sport. However as I started to gather references I did come to realise that Yuri on Ice has taken over a large part of figure skating fandom, especially the art side.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Quick sketches using references" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/wap-13.2-8dd1b9d79a4c78f81f559dd2f86eedb2.jpg" width="3072" height="1794" class="img_wQsy"></p>

<p>Since I’m more focused on the body and not so much the whole scene of figure skating I did only want to focus on the physical pose for my reference studies. So this meant no drawing fancy figure skating outfits or hair styles.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/wap-13.3.1-b9fc435cd72d4926f6200541dcd32850.jpg" width="3000" height="2000" class="img_wQsy"></p>

<p>By this day I was thinking that I should pull up some lessons on different figure drawing approaches. Some people have some lovely styled ways of doing figure drawing while others have some extremely detailed shapes that they use to really analyse the pose. My own approach is a bit of a mishmash of the styles I learned last year which I don’t feel like is either super stylized or super accurate. So in my next anatomy focused week I think I want to find a more refined approach.</p>

<p>Trying to find art of figure skaters is where the Yuri on Ice characters dominate. I didn’t want to pull directly from anime which led to having to restrict my choices a bit. I found someone else basically doing the thing I’m trying to do, figure skater pose sketches:</p>

<p>After doing these few I kind of wish I had just used a bunch of Yuri on Ice references and decided to go for an anime style fully instead of just the one piece.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_FNw8" id="day-5---drawing-from-imagination">Day 5 - Drawing from imagination<a href="https://kymira.ca/blog/wap-13#day-5---drawing-from-imagination" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Day 5 - Drawing from imagination" title="Direct link to Day 5 - Drawing from imagination">​</a></h2>
<p>Due to my procrastinating I did day 4 and day 5 on the same day. This maybe gives some advantage to day 5, even just on the level of being warmed up before starting.</p>
<p>Instead of doing multiple takes I decided to take the first pose that came to mind and went through a few fixing stages. Extend a few limbs, keep having to make the head bigger. Just fixes to try to get the anatomy closer and closer to correct.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/wap-13.5-af21e0fa2a071a57a6c05acefce33db1.jpg" width="3000" height="2000" class="img_wQsy"></p>

<p>While I was procrastinating on doing my studies I did a watercolor practice instead. I save Youtube tutorials as they pop up if they look interesting and within my skill level so this is the one I followed this week.</p>

<p>This took about 30 minutes which made for a nice quick dip back into watercolours. I haven’t touched them much since last summer, it just doesn’t feel like a winter medium for art.</p>

<p>I kind of regret choosing figure skaters as my subject matter for my first anatomy week. They have so many weird poses and there is constant foreshortening or hidden parts of the body in the photos. My girlfriend says this makes for a good challenge but it definitely led to me dragging my feet on doing simple studies because of how messed up looking they were coming out.</p>
<p>But I do think it sets a good benchmark. If I was a master of anatomy I would be able to piece together what the body is doing in the areas I can’t see. I didn’t feel super confident in the guesses I made in these but it will be a good sign of improvement later on when I feel like I can make those conclusions.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As mentioned in my last WAP, I’ve made a return to creature drawing to have some easier WAP weeks. I’m not sure how I got the idea for anteaters, possibly Pinterest simply showed me an image of one and I went “whoa strange dog.”</p>
<p>I also tried out a new practice method that I learned from a YouTube video this week. It… didn’t go great.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_FNw8" id="day-1---drawing-from-imagination">Day 1 - Drawing from imagination<a href="https://kymira.ca/blog/wap-12#day-1---drawing-from-imagination" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Day 1 - Drawing from imagination" title="Direct link to Day 1 - Drawing from imagination">​</a></h2>
<p>I had just put together my Pinterest board the day before so giant anteaters were fresh on my mind when I went into day 1.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/wap-12.1-a9c0a4eba44958ab2140d82114afb96e.jpg" width="2972" height="1865" class="img_wQsy"></p>

<p>Day 1 here felt like one of my best day ones so far. At least for accuracy. The main error being how I did the ears. Day two saw some improvements for anatomy. But it was also here that I started to notice that there aren’t that many different images of giant anteaters. Like, I couldn’t find more than one or two of them lying down. None just sitting.</p>

<p>Spending more time on day 3 meant paying a little more attention to their colouration patterns. Which is mostly that big black triangle.</p>

<p>Style studies are still my favourite for animal weeks. I tried to move from more realistic to more simplistic.</p>

<p>Remembering my problem with movement from previous animal challenges, I spent some time before doing my day 5 test watching videos of giant anteaters. YouTube didn’t have a great collection of these. But enough that I finally got to see their front feet in action. It wasn’t until day 5 that I learnt that giant anteaters walk on their knuckles (like gorillas) to protect their very sharp and huge front claws.</p>
<p>Also learned that they fight back against jaguars by using those large claws and standing up on their back legs, using their huge tail as a kind of tripod support to stay upright. So I tried drawing this upright position even though I never saw an image of them taking this pose.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/wap-12.5-e4d64a2b3e0e3dd87227cf183f98aa0c.jpg" width="2400" height="1400" class="img_wQsy"></p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_FNw8" id="blind-study-method">Blind study method<a href="https://kymira.ca/blog/wap-12#blind-study-method" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Blind study method" title="Direct link to Blind study method">​</a></h2>
<p>Every now and then YouTube will recommend a decent art tutorial video. I’m always on the hunt for things like guided practice and different ways to study so this one got my attention.</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AB9yTNfE3go?si=9xy_U650xEzygCeK" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin"></iframe>
<p>I liked the sound of this approach because it’s similar to how I would practise for exams. Making flash cards, going through the movements of questions and answers. I also liked the idea of giving yourself just an hour to do it.</p>
<p>My study subject for my first attempt is this <a href="https://www.artstation.com/artwork/GGNw4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">drow piece by Anna Siwoń</a>. I like the grumpy expression so that’s what I wanted to focus on.</p>
<p>The idea is to first draw the image while looking at it. Then take the reference away and try to do it again. Make corrections, spot where you went wrong. Then hide the reference again and try again.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/blindstudy1-24430bad6b4502ff7a839279d9ba685a.jpg" width="1307" height="955" class="img_wQsy"></p>

<p>I honestly felt like I was getting worse and worse as the attempts went on. So I’m not sure how I feel about this just yet. I should probably try with either a smaller focus or on something more generic. I’m not sure yet.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_FNw8" id="conclusion">Conclusion<a href="https://kymira.ca/blog/wap-12#conclusion" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Conclusion" title="Direct link to Conclusion">​</a></h2>
<p>I felt like I got a decent amount of practice time in this week. The anteaters didn’t take very long each day. Finally feels like getting back in the grove after Renpy month. Main downside being that anteaters are so unique and weird I’m not sure when learning their shape is going to be helpful again. Maybe in monster creation or something like that.</p>
<p>I hope to try to blind practice method again but I’m having my doubts. There are other approaches for learning other artists styles which I might try out instead. Compare the methods and see which one works best for me.</p>

<p>When it comes down to it, books are just squares. So it was pretty easy to quickly draw some squares.</p>

<p>On day 2 I started to recognize an early hangup of this subject. Since books are basically just squares I’d much rather draw them digitally using square or line making tools for consistency. But doing any sort of intricate design on the cover, something that’s often requiring small, repetitive motions, is something I’d rather do with traditional media. I wanted to get better at drawing straight lines so I didn’t even end up letting myself use the square or line tools for day 2. So these came out rather messy and not detailed.</p>

<p>Tried to force myself into doing more time on these but I just don’t have the patience for doing detailed designs. So I swapped to doing more book themed scenes. Which are more engaging but the idea of drawing 100 books in a scene is a really big turn off.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/wap-11.3-acf159dfe7cb33c0d5bbb43506b7f99c.jpg" width="1001" height="1463" class="img_wQsy"></p>
<p>I ended up spending more time trying to find a brush that would give me irregular squares to quickly fill shelves. I didn’t find exactly what I wanted in Clip Studio so kind of just moved on.</p>

<p>For the style study I decided to do a scene study. Just wanted to try blocking in the shapes and creating a scene. I’m once again worried that this might be an AI piece, the one clue being “wtf is up with these hanging lights? Are they inside or outside? Is that pumpkin on the right attached to the tree?”</p>

<p>I was actually kind of happy with the stylized look of the building in the end, but got tired by the time I should start filling out the inside of the building so I just rushed through with the bare minimum.</p>

<p>I really wasn’t sure what to do for drawing from imagination day since I struggled to find any main take away lessons from the practice days. I decided to go for drawing the bookshelf that was next to me. Which happens to actually not be many books.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/wap-11.5-b8b458f68b45910837e895503803c8d8.jpg" width="1060" height="2052" class="img_wQsy"></p>
<p>It was still pretty painful to draw the books that were there. Was mostly hype about doing the skull. I was originally going to go into more details but the weekend quickly disappeared so just tried to push through to get the space filled.</p>

<p>Another week I didn’t find particularly inspiring. Trying to do too much and too little at the same time.</p>
<p>I’m probably going to go back to animals for a bit to re-find my groove with these weekly practices. Then every few weeks I’m going to try to focus on human anatomy and movement since I know it’s such a key area if I want to get comfortable drawing characters again.</p>
<p>This week I also found a YouTube video explaining a blind study method for art that got my attention because it’s similar to how I would study for school. It’s a practice that you should put at least an hour aside to do so I’m going to try to find time to do it at least once next week between whatever animal I end up choosing.</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Week 10 - Sword swing]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>WAP is back.</p>
<p>It was hard to get back into this practice style after a month away. I kind of forgot the physical steps of it and had to remind myself of what the days were for. Maybe it didn’t help that my returning subject was a more difficult one: Swinging swords.</p>
<p>I had wanted to do something a little more dynamic pose wise. But it one where anatomy is so important that without a really good grasp of the photo body references, doing style studies feels extra challenging as I’m not 100% sure what’s correct.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_FNw8" id="day-1---drawing-from-imagination">Day 1 - Drawing from imagination<a href="https://kymira.ca/blog/wap-10#day-1---drawing-from-imagination" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Day 1 - Drawing from imagination" title="Direct link to Day 1 - Drawing from imagination">​</a></h2>
<p>Feeling rusty that’s for sure. Dynamic poses without a reference are up there on the difficulty scale so there are just so many bad proportions here. I was feeling pretty done with it after just doing 3 half bodies but I think pushing myself to fill the page helped a lot to go beyond my comfort zone.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/wap-10.1-267c2a2c1c0613af6a34ecfa7004f392.jpg" width="3020" height="1882" class="img_wQsy"></p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_FNw8" id="day-2---figure-sketching">Day 2 - Figure sketching<a href="https://kymira.ca/blog/wap-10#day-2---figure-sketching" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Day 2 - Figure sketching" title="Direct link to Day 2 - Figure sketching">​</a></h2>
<p>I ended up doing way more pages of day 2 than usual. I have wanted to up the speed in which these speed studies are done and I found that action poses take up a fair bit of room on the page.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Quick sketches using references" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/wap-10.2.1-979dcab046c8ed50531973335d59ca86.jpg" width="3040" height="1870" class="img_wQsy">

<p>It was harder than I thought it would be to find photographs of sword fighting action. Lots of fencing, some historical style with samurai swords, but not too much else. Found one or two shots of actors learning some choreography, but definitely expected more LARP-like content. But I also was trying to focus on what looked professional so that the people in the photos had proper form. But given I don’t know what proper form looks like it’s not something I should realistically be trying to judge.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_FNw8" id="day-3---reference-studies">Day 3 - Reference studies<a href="https://kymira.ca/blog/wap-10#day-3---reference-studies" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Day 3 - Reference studies" title="Direct link to Day 3 - Reference studies">​</a></h2>
<p>While working on these I started to consider a good practice approach to be choosing one pose and trying to draw it from multiple angles. Just to pursue trying to understand the pose and not just ignoring anything that the limbs or the weapon hide from view. I didn’t end up doing that because I wanted to try out a variety of poses. But if I revisit the subject I might give it a shot.</p>

<p>I didn’t feel like I had any really solid discoveries or moments of enlightenment from working from this style studies. A lot comes back to having a good grasp of anatomy and understanding how the body moves. I didn’t notice that one of the arms in the Solo Leveling reference was pretty messed up which then made me question the pose overall. But given that it’s a screenshot it’s not like it’s an image that was meant to be overly scrutinised. What seems more important is being able to “sell” the movement.</p>

<p>I possibly made the mistake of waiting 3 days to do the final test day. Felt like the knowledge had already left my head.</p>

<p>I can’t say I loved this week. It was difficult and nothing was really coming out as I hoped. It’s been a while since I’ve done a full body pose and it shows. Really thinking that what I should be doing is spending a week every month on figure drawing just to get confident in human bodies again.</p>
<p>If I can find some good references I’d like to try again as weapon poses are very much what I’d like to be doing with D&amp;D art but it feels like there are lots of pieces to master before pulling off dynamic poses.</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Final Renpy progress and other works]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>My approach to March was to put my Weekly Art Practice on hold while participating in NaNoRenO in an attempt to really push my art skills into focusing on scenes and backgrounds. I felt like I started off pretty strong on this mission but at this point in the month I know it’s not gonna happen.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_FNw8" id="nanoreno">NaNoRenO<a href="https://kymira.ca/blog/march-wrap-up#nanoreno" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to NaNoRenO" title="Direct link to NaNoRenO">​</a></h2>
<p>While I spat out over 8 different backgrounds in 2 weeks, when I went to switch into writing mode I wasn’t really feeling the project any more. I have most of the ideas fleshed out but I don’t love it. I also don’t get the same creative hit from writing as I do from working on visual art.</p>
<p>I did enjoy troubleshooting the Ren’py setup though. I was able to get randomised scene selection working with modatory scenes in between. If I were to do the project again I would probably try to team up with a writer instead of trying to tackle it all on my own. For this project my girlfriend says she’s tempted to take a shot at doing the writing so maybe it will turn into a game in the end.</p>
<p>One thing I learned about taking on a month-long project was that it was a great way to trigger my procrastination instincts. I finished 2 whole games this month, one of which I had been putting off for ages. The Return of Obra Dinn (which only took 2 days) and Tears of the Kingdom, which it turns out I was only about 15 hours from the end when I put it down months ago. So now I know that if I want to finish some other things all I need to do is give myself a big project to avoid.</p>
<p>I did do one last piece for the project last week. The only character who makes an appearance, a fisherman who stops by the lighthouse to give the main character supplies.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="A fisherman wearing blue-grey overalls, a beige sweater and a green knit hat." src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/sl-fisherman-fea86689b7dda0cc0c11ee866c546c67.png" width="837" height="1360" class="img_wQsy"></p>
<p>The vibe for the game that I wanted to aim for was everything seems to be fine, this is like learning what a day in the life of a lighthouse keeper is. But with a pretty quick reveal that something isn’t right. Minor hints of this were going to be added to the background pieces but I think there’s only one visible now. This led to the choice to keep the kind of dead, beady eyes my fisherman sketch had in the final product. I wanted him to also look a little off.</p>
<p>All in all the first two weeks were a great crash course in doing completed scenes. But I quickly started to miss my weekly art practice. Having clear goals every day really helps with focus and a sense of accomplishment. The variety and change up every week helps too, so it felt almost odd to focus on a single project for a whole month.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_FNw8" id="a-different-kind-of-scene">A different kind of scene<a href="https://kymira.ca/blog/march-wrap-up#a-different-kind-of-scene" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to A different kind of scene" title="Direct link to A different kind of scene">​</a></h2>
<p>Since I kind of “ran out” of pieces to work on for the Ren'py project but didn’t want to resume weekly art practice yet I started a new, very large piece. It’s not large in pixels but it does feel large in ambition. This is what I have so far:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="A 3 story pink stone building. Two balconies above a shop front that hasn’t been drawn in yet." src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/dragon-flowers-wip-67e4267b2e6026bb69fbc0bb4b100fe9.jpg" width="1057" height="2000" class="img_wQsy"></p>
<p>My Ren’py work did make me more comfortable with scenes and trying out new styles. I wanted to work on something similar but with references that would help a scene be recognizable. A challenge to make a piece that could still resemble the references. So this is a representation of Dragon Flowers, a famous Montreal flower shop. Or at least it’s old location. The store has had a rough few years.</p>
<p>I started with the upper balconies, trying to focus on smaller segments to not feel too overwhelmed. Dragon Flowers always has a lot of stuff outside the shop, and I honestly find it rather chaotic. But it’s what makes it an interesting challenge. My goal will be to work on it when I still feel like drawing after doing my daily WAP goals.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_FNw8" id="conclusion">Conclusion<a href="https://kymira.ca/blog/march-wrap-up#conclusion" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Conclusion" title="Direct link to Conclusion">​</a></h2>
<p>While I’m not ending the month with a completed game as I had planned, the amount of time I spent in Clip Studio, trying out new brushes, doing research into lighting and scenes did lead to a lot of learning. I actually even enjoyed working on all the scenes. I do still wish I could find a consistent style (I’m constantly agonising over what kind of brush I should use for inking, how big should it be???). But overall I don’t think the pieces I did this month vary too wildly from one another.</p>
<p>Next month I’m going to get back into regular practice and blogging.</p>]]></content>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Week 2 progress overview]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Week 2 has been a rather slow one. The time change hit me really hard so I felt a little ill the first few days just from my sleep getting messed with. Then my other projects and volunteer work took up a fair bit of space on other days. And today I’m off to get a tattoo which likely won’t leave me in a “go make art” kind of mood after either. So we’re in challenging times!</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_FNw8" id="backgrounds">Backgrounds<a href="https://kymira.ca/blog/nanoreno2#backgrounds" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Backgrounds" title="Direct link to Backgrounds">​</a></h2>
<p>While I only did two backgrounds this week I am rather happy with them. The first was this big storm scene. I did some research into painting storm clouds and then also into waves (which I often find difficult). The lightning looks rather unnatural due to being from a lightning brush but I kind of like how much it stands out as it is the focus of the pieces.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Top of a lighthouse looking out at rough waves. A large bolt of lightning moves between storm clouds." src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/sl-storm-bg-0cd4ae14d8b8a855e5fe4fbb0d883b14.jpg" width="1920" height="1080" class="img_wQsy"></p>
<p>The second background has a lot of simple cheats for doing woodsy backdrops but it takes a lot of time to fill all the layers this kind of piece needs. So I spent two evenings chipping away at this one. But I feel like the shading does pull things together and convey depth in the scene. I could probably make it even stronger by doing more obvious lighting but I was starting to feel like I needed to move on… to resting on the couch and watching tv.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Stag on a path in the woods." src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/sl-forest-bg-ab1c6ec7c42d36def3ca5b04b7cee573.jpg" width="1920" height="1080" class="img_wQsy"></p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_FNw8" id="website-update">Website update<a href="https://kymira.ca/blog/nanoreno2#website-update" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Website update" title="Direct link to Website update">​</a></h2>
<p>This is such a small website change that I suspect no one would notice unless I point it out. But I started using my own favicon to replace the default Docusaurus one (even though I do love the Docusaurus dinosaur). It’s now this guy, which was an attempt at making a 16x16px squirrel for a possible GameBoy game but I think it looks a little more dog-like? But at least some sort of creature-like but I like that it might not be obvious.</p>

<p>This coming week I’m going to try to start working on writing. I’m a little uncertain about this as I’m pulled to do most of my writing in Google Docs as that’s where most of my work lives but due to the formatting of things it will probably be easiest to work in the text editor that I use to open the Ren’py code files.</p>
<p>I find myself already missing my weekly art practice as it was so much easier to only to commit to things for 1 week at a time.</p>]]></content>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Progress in my first week of participating in NaNoRenO]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Week 1 of NaNoRenO is over, so time for a re-cap of what I could get through this week. This will definitely contain spoilers, I guess?? But also the game is completely in flux so who knows what a real spoiler is.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_FNw8" id="renpy">Ren’py<a href="https://kymira.ca/blog/nanoreno1#renpy" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Ren’py" title="Direct link to Ren’py">​</a></h2>
<p>My biggest game “mechanic” that I wanted to be able to incorporate was randomising the order of scenes a player could get. It ended up being easy enough to find other people asking for example how to do this. So I took some code samples shared in a forum and started to experiment with how to use it. So far so good, now I just need to not get lost in it while filling in the content.</p>
<p>Something I don’t love about Ren’py is that it seems like the bulk of the game is in a single file. It will probably make it easier to hunt for errors in the future but I’m very worried about how messy the file will get.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_FNw8" id="backgrounds">Backgrounds<a href="https://kymira.ca/blog/nanoreno1#backgrounds" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Backgrounds" title="Direct link to Backgrounds">​</a></h2>
<p>My main focus for the week was backgrounds. With the second day being troubleshooting why my image isn't filling the screen properly. Spent a fair bit of time researching why this could happen only to finally find that it was my own Clip Studio Paint save setting that was re-sizing the output. Oops. Which is why at the end of day one this was all the progress I had to show.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Quick sketches using references" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/day1-9690de712c4ebb62d9e37ed498b55b1a.png" width="1718" height="993" class="img_wQsy"></p>
<p>With that solved I spent each day trying to complete one background. As of today I have 6, having taken 2 days easy after longer work days. So I’m pretty happy about that. It’s nearly 50% of the backgrounds I had planned for.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="A collection of 5 background images." src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/week1-bgs-2d0d5a96a1860282b11b8cec2ea669bf.jpg" width="1600" height="1300" class="img_wQsy"></p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_FNw8" id="planning">Planning<a href="https://kymira.ca/blog/nanoreno1#planning" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Planning" title="Direct link to Planning">​</a></h2>
<p>I had done my original game flow layout before the month started (which you are allowed to do!). I had originally planned to make the first prototype of this game in Twine so I had that downloaded and ready to go. I’m more familiar with Twine so I used it to lay down the main beats/scenes as well as the progression path. Which resulted in this:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Screenshot of Twine boxes" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/scene-flow-18030958df0a3a9ad94993d405d7ef75.png" width="1390" height="1042" class="img_wQsy"></p>
<p>This is what helped me count how many backgrounds I would need and how many scenes I would have to write.</p>
<p>I’ve only written a few lines so far, I should really start getting other ideas down. But I have confidence in my writing speed and less confidence in my drawing speed so the creation of the assets is my biggest priority while I still have new project excitement.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_FNw8" id="conclusion">Conclusion<a href="https://kymira.ca/blog/nanoreno1#conclusion" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Conclusion" title="Direct link to Conclusion">​</a></h2>
<p>I do feel my desire for drawing backgrounds already waning. But buying new brushes and finding ways to “cheat” a look I want to do still feels nice. In some places, like the fence in the garden scene, I tried to find a fence brush that would help me spit that out in a second. But after trying 3 or 4 I gave up and drew one segment then repeated it. For the ropes in the outdoor lighthouse scene that was an easy brush to find so I could just do 2 lines then done. So there is a bit of a treasure hunt quality to some of the tasks which I enjoy. Found a water reflection brush that I feel like works really well so I’m no longer afraid to fill the space on large bodies of water.</p>
<p>The indoor scenes though, yikes.</p>
<p>I did a fair bit of research into lighthouses before I started (and still am really). But there are very few images of the inside of lighthouses. And these days when you try to research them, what you’re going to find is remodelled lighthouses turned into Air B&amp;Bs. Which is very much not what I’m looking for.</p>
<p>So with indoor scenes being a weakness and having basically zero reference images to work from, I’m afraid these rooms are going to look rather wild as I continue to draw more of them. I’m proud of the desk scene at least. That’s the first image in the game so I wanted to at least not hate it. While a few of the backgrounds I’ve done I do hate already. But we only have a month so can’t dwell on trying to fix them, it’s on to the next image.</p>]]></content>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Week 9 - Trees]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Spending a week on trees is kind of a weird one. It’s pretty rare that I would want to draw a singular tree, more often I’d be wanting to draw a forest as part of a landscape or some simple background shapes where the tree isn’t one of the pain focal points. But I still wanted to do this week to spend time looking at West Coast trees and try to find ways to quickly construct trees that I could possibly re-use for the NaNoRenO project.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_FNw8" id="day-1---drawing-from-imagination">Day 1 - Drawing from imagination<a href="https://kymira.ca/blog/wap-9#day-1---drawing-from-imagination" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Day 1 - Drawing from imagination" title="Direct link to Day 1 - Drawing from imagination">​</a></h2>
<p>It’s pretty easy to mentally bring up an image of a tree, but even my mental image of a tree is way more simplified than what a tree actually looks like. It’s easy to think of triangle pin trees, or apple trees that are mostly just a green circle for the leaves and then a trunk. Trying to be realistic mostly feels like drawing leaves and branches until you get tired of it.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/wap-9.1-be09459b9375e1293427784130d96c84.jpg" width="2265" height="1218" class="img_wQsy"></p>
<p>I did take a stab at some non-local tree types that were in my head from preparing my reference photos the day before. There are some very interesting trees out there.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_FNw8" id="day-2---figure-sketching">Day 2 - Figure sketching<a href="https://kymira.ca/blog/wap-9#day-2---figure-sketching" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Day 2 - Figure sketching" title="Direct link to Day 2 - Figure sketching">​</a></h2>
<p>Tried to make myself speed up for figure sketching this week. It worked for the first three, mostly just laying down shapes. After that I spent more time thinking about the smaller parts of the tree and wanting to give them more detail as the first 3 felt like messy blobs.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Quick sketches using references" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/wap-9.2-2127aef8068c95dfabf690327fd33d61.jpg" width="1941" height="1386" class="img_wQsy"></p>

<p>It was a little strange to do reference studies since I know my goal for the end of the week isn’t to replicate trees exactly. At this point I started to play around with brushes to lay down leaves faster, using the reference mostly for shape.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/wap-9.3-a8fb03e89c19cd10347ea006262d8b53.jpg" width="3072" height="1728" class="img_wQsy"></p>
<p>I did multiple pine trees because I knew I’d be drawing a lot of them in March. These were pretty simple in that I just tried out 3 different brushes to act as the pine needles. Then on the more detailed one I just tried hand drawing a bunch of branches. Which didn’t actually take too long in the end.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_FNw8" id="day-4---style-studies">Day 4 - Style studies<a href="https://kymira.ca/blog/wap-9#day-4---style-studies" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Day 4 - Style studies" title="Direct link to Day 4 - Style studies">​</a></h2>
<p>There were a lot of different styles I wanted to spend time on but it could have been a project for the whole week. First I tried some of the vector styles that I had tried a bit when doing lighthouses &amp; landscape week. And then a more cartoon-y style that I like a lot for it’s flow.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/wap-9.4.1-e8c5ff7d1fd983da37b6901c7be1bbf1.jpg" width="3072" height="1728" class="img_wQsy"></p>

<p>Then I tried for some watercolours but remembered the watercolour brushes I like are on Procreate and not in Clip. So I don’t feel like I was able to really re-create the right style there. But I like the originals and may pursue them on paper someday.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/wap-9.4.2-33a9658608b4d571d7a4ac0a1144f9be.jpg" width="3072" height="1728" class="img_wQsy"></p>

<p>Then I wanted to do a more painterly one. I liked how blocky this one was and used some new square brushes that I was finally able to find. Pretty happy with this vibe but don’t feel like it’s a great fit for trying to draw a whole forest.</p>

<p>There were a lot of tree styles I liked so I attempted to do a variety of them from memory. The vector type, the take it slow type, and a block-y painting type.</p>

<p>I don’t feel like I have strong takeaways from this week except for the new found curiosity to keep exploring other styles. I wasn’t expecting trees to have so much variety but I guess since they are one of the most common elements to a nature scene they are re-produced constantly. So I can see re-visiting trees in the future as there are more on my Pinterest board I’d like to experiment with.</p>
<p>With NaNoRenO starting today I’m thinking of putting my Weekly Art Practice work on pause while I focus on all the art pieces needed for the VN. Got a few scene sketches started today, a meer fraction of the work ahead for the planned project. But I’ll probably keep to weekly blogging just with sharing game progress instead of practice progress.</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Week 8 - Lighthouses and landscapes]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This week is another alternate take on the format. With the plan to do NaNoRenO in March, I know I’ll need to draw a look of backgrounds in a short amount of time. The game I’ve been ruminating on is set around a lighthouse which would mean a lot of outdoor shots and probably some establishing landscape shots. These have never been a strength of mine so I wanted to spend a week trying to figure out a style that would work for both:</p>
<ol>
<li>The vibe of the game</li>
<li>Could be executed quickly</li>
</ol>
<p>This leads to trying to find the right balance of detailing. I attempted to try out a few different approaches to this, taking lots of inspiration from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dkX9Ul6kywM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jacob Drawfee's “I made myself draw backgrounds every day for a week”</a>. While also trying to remember the main take aways from the <a href="https://www.kymira.ca/blog/landscapes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">landscape course</a> I did last year.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_FNw8" id="day-1---drawing-from-imagination">Day 1 - Drawing from imagination<a href="https://kymira.ca/blog/wap-8#day-1---drawing-from-imagination" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Day 1 - Drawing from imagination" title="Direct link to Day 1 - Drawing from imagination">​</a></h2>
<p>Day 1 was the usual attempt to draw from imagination. I did some quick sketches to try to just think about composition and maybe about the kind of view I wanted to have for the game.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Sketchbook sketches of coastlines" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/wap-8.1-abb5d3e13d5a49814dbafce61b1ea84c.jpg" width="1630" height="2829" class="img_wQsy"></p>
<p>I also did some digital attempts on day 1 because I had the time. I tried to limit each one to an hour, focusing on laying down blocks and colours.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Steven Universe inspired style of coastlines" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/wap-8.1.2-158d54db4bf4ae7000ab80410fd6f813.jpg" width="3134" height="2233" class="img_wQsy"></p>
<p>Keep these first attempts in mind as we move through the next ones.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_FNw8" id="day-2---testing-styles">Day 2 - Testing styles<a href="https://kymira.ca/blog/wap-8#day-2---testing-styles" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Day 2 - Testing styles" title="Direct link to Day 2 - Testing styles">​</a></h2>
<p>I had gathered up a lot of different stylized landscapes for the week, a lot of them ended up being this kind of vector style which I do find rather quick to execute. For the first piece I just tried to copy the vibe without vectors to see if I could keep it so clean.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Vector landscape studies" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/wap-8.2.1-cd9f142c8d3f9ab1a65528635113c23e.jpg" width="1133" height="753" class="img_wQsy"></p>

<p>Then I chose a reference image and tried out a few more painterly + cartoon style. I didn’t love this and it felt like it sucked up a lot of time with little reward.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Painting studies." src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/wap-8.2.2-4696e021db3772f164f28f33bb4b3ab1.jpg" width="2748" height="1173" class="img_wQsy"></p>

<p>Now we’re into style practices. This first one is an image I really loved when I saw it. I have a high suspicion that it’s AI created and now I’m wondering if I should just spend my live re-drawing AI art. In this instance I changed it up by replacing the cabin with a lighthouse.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/wap-8.3-f800c94dec7af4a00874dd1a5873a4c0.jpg" width="1471" height="1474" class="img_wQsy"></p>
<p>This piece took somewhere from 3-4 hours. Not ideal but I am pretty pleased with it. I found ways to speed it up and also found some brushes for texture I really liked as well.</p>

<p>I gave myself an extra practice day this week since there was so much I wanted to cover. This time I was working from a photograph again.</p>
<p>For the first I wanted to try to be slightly more detailed but still kind of simple blocks for the buildings. The field is a bit of a trap in that you can spend so much time trying to detail grass and flowers. I could see myself enjoying this but it wasn’t the focus of the piece and I don’t think I’ll be drawing many grass fields next month.</p>

<p>For the extra day I wanted to try another simple looking style. A little bit like a comic or graphic novel. Flat colours and maybe more detailed line work. I also like this as a style but we’ll see in my final test how I’m going to struggle to really adapt it to my west coast inspired scenery.</p>

<p>For this last challenge I time boxed myself to 1 hour to see how far I could get in that amount of time. I wanted to prioritise the kind of flat colours style from the previous challenge while using some of the vector tricks to add depth or texture in the distance.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/wap-8.5-56c63e9d8f327e1f843edaffa51e95e7.jpg" width="3072" height="1728" class="img_wQsy"></p>
<p>It does feel like with another hour I could get to something I like. Though I’m not sure if this style is really what I want for the project. I just feel like I’d like a little more texture. Working in some watercolour techniques might be my next exercises.</p>

<p>This was a fun week but it was also very time consuming. For most of the piece I put in 2-3 hours every day into working on something. Which is more time than I had planned to devote to art practice every week. But it also felt good to work on things outside my comfort zone again.</p>
<p>Next week is going to be a slightly complimentary exercise, but on a much smaller scope. I want to try to just draw a bunch of trees.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This week we’re back in my comfort zone; drawing creatures.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_FNw8" id="day-1---drawing-from-imagination">Day 1 - Drawing from imagination<a href="https://kymira.ca/blog/wap-7#day-1---drawing-from-imagination" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Day 1 - Drawing from imagination" title="Direct link to Day 1 - Drawing from imagination">​</a></h2>
<p>Day 1 felt decently smooth. Rabbit’s aren’t the most complicated creatures and I feel like I see them in images on a regular basis (unlike pangolins).</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/wap-7.1-c127680f4fa0b5ae2cdd8b6f8748e26c.jpg" width="3063" height="1785" class="img_wQsy"></p>

<p>I feel like I keep giving myself more and more time for the day 2 practice but I really need to start forcing myself to limit how much time I spend on each sketch. It’s just nice to stare at cute bunnies.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Rabbit sketches using references in a sketchbook." src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/wap-7.2-3e97b2b73011d131d30ba62540ebc1de.jpg" width="3072" height="1874" class="img_wQsy"></p>

<p>Day 3 spent analysing the inner bean shape of rabbits, smaller chest area, larger hide quarters and face slightly similar to a squirrel but like a soft sided triangle. A decent amount of squirrel similarities really. But rounder.</p>

<p>My favourite day! There is so much rabbit art out there. And so much from Japan and Korean with such cute simple styles. Overall I worry that the styles I chose were a little too simple as Pinterest was pretty full of this kind of thing.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/wap-7.4.2-f3dbc6a4b189038b6ce7c367e69087dd.jpg" width="2400" height="1600" class="img_wQsy"></p>
<p>I found one batch that has a more Disney-type look to it. More details, more kind of human expressions on them. But with some really fun proportion play with feet and ears.</p>

<p>These little guys are very good and I was intrigued by the broken line art style. Where you leave gaps in the lineart to convey the fuzzy or fluffiness. I never try this myself as I worry I don’t have the knowledge to know when to break it up and when not too but after staring at these I don’t think there’s a solid rule to it. So maybe something I can incorporate into other creature drawings.</p>

<p>These guys were probably my favourites for their mix of simplicity and identifying characteristics. 12 different types of buns, most of them being visually unique. A big thing for rabbits seems to be mixing up the line work to show different fur types, from the very shaggy to the shorter haired guys.</p>

<p>The simplest style of all. Very minimal detail, but still very much rabbits based on their small limbs.</p>

<p>I put a non drawing day between day 4 and 5 this week. I’m still not sure if this is better for absorbing lessons or not. I did feel a little creatively stuck when I started, thinking directly of the images I had sketched just days before. While rabbits are nice to look at and all, I felt like I had limited pose material to choose from. I think what I really need to start pushing myself to do is to change my perspective on creatures, move the camera up and down, and have more angles. Just to keep things interesting and see if I understand the shapes from all sides.</p>

<p>While I appreciated returning to a nice easy creature week, I don’t feel as confident about my takeaways due to rabbits being mostly fur. They are another creature that I feel like I should take some time looking at skeletal references to understand what’s going on under all the fluff. Instead of just drawing shapes that imply a rabbit underneath.</p>
<p>I’m making some edits to my subjects for the next few weeks as I’m considering participating in <a href="https://itch.io/jam/nanoreno-2024" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NaNoRenO</a>. A yearly game jam where you try to make a visual novel in the software Ren’py within the month of March. I had already started brainstorming a text based game a few weeks before a friend mentioned the game jam to me. And now it feels like kind of perfect timing. Creatively if not great life timing.</p>
<p>You are allowed to create any art assets before March 1st but I know my landscape skills are rusty from last year's lesson on them, so next week I’ll try to do a week of landscape / coastal vistas while trying to figure out an art style that will work for very quick asset creation in March.</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Week 6 - Goblins]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This week we’re breaking from the format. Kind of in a small way, kind of in a big way. For this week I chose goblins.</p>
<p>Now it’s kind of just like doing another creature, except it has humanoid anatomy and it’s well, not real. There are no real life photographs to learn from for fictional creatures. I wasn’t sure exactly how I was going to deal with this lack when I started the week but I feel like I found a decent formula.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_FNw8" id="day-1---drawing-from-imagination">Day 1 - Drawing from imagination<a href="https://kymira.ca/blog/wap-6#day-1---drawing-from-imagination" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Day 1 - Drawing from imagination" title="Direct link to Day 1 - Drawing from imagination">​</a></h2>
<p>Day 1 was just like other day ones. I had just recently put together my Pinterest board of goblins so they were decently fresh in my head when I sat down to do this.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/wap-6.1-eb39514b669a929f0d174d6c7af8fcce.jpg" width="2310" height="1293" class="img_wQsy"></p>
<p>Still have that usual day 1 messiness but there was one standout face for me.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/wap-6.1.2-75b12f487f6881af7a9a75f2886f3333.jpg" width="800" height="659" class="img_wQsy"></p>
<p>This guy surprises me, one of those “did I draw that??” moments. It’s not like it’s overly complicated but I would usually need to be looking at a reference to get down that face shape!</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_FNw8" id="day-2---figure-sketching">Day 2 - Figure sketching<a href="https://kymira.ca/blog/wap-6#day-2---figure-sketching" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Day 2 - Figure sketching" title="Direct link to Day 2 - Figure sketching">​</a></h2>
<p>For this day 2 I didn’t use photographs but instead tried to pull from my whole Pinterest board. I jumped around from image to image, whichever caught my attention. With a goal of trying out very different goblin styles.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Goblin sketches using references." src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/wap-6.2-b19d0501db4d5bfd8805026819cb02fa.jpg" width="2104" height="3264" class="img_wQsy"></p>
<p>I had hoped to be able to put together a bit of a visual history of goblins and identify current goblin media designs, but Pinterest wasn’t super great at providing that selection. The big ones that came to mind were Magic the Gathering goblins and D&amp;D goblins. Then throw in some cartoon goblins like the ones from Adventure Time. This is probably a do-able project but it would have taken many more days than the hour or so I gave myself to collect references and read the Wikipedia page on goblin origins.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_FNw8" id="day-3---reference-studies">Day 3 - Reference studies<a href="https://kymira.ca/blog/wap-6#day-3---reference-studies" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Day 3 - Reference studies" title="Direct link to Day 3 - Reference studies">​</a></h2>
<p>For day 3 I took my favourite little guys from day 2 and spent more time on them. Tried to look critically at face shape, general body proportions, and ears. These are the standout goblin qualities to me.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/wap-6.3-0aed7a010714ab3eb8426afad476472e.jpg" width="2400" height="1600" class="img_wQsy"></p>
<p>These three felt like they covered different vibes well. I flubbed the very cartoon guys as I tried to push myself on that one instead of re-creating since they had such simple shapes. Maybe not so simple after all…</p>
<p>The ones in red are what I did after the main three. Trying to merge things together and try to identify what kind of vibe I wanted to bring to my own goblin style.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_FNw8" id="day-4---style-studies">Day 4 - Style studies<a href="https://kymira.ca/blog/wap-6#day-4---style-studies" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Day 4 - Style studies" title="Direct link to Day 4 - Style studies">​</a></h2>
<p>Now day 4 is usually style study, but I had basically done that on day 3. I didn’t want to come out of this week having just ripped off someone else’s goblin design so for day 4 I wanted to try out creature design.</p>
<p>I chose my main contenters from day 3 (leaving out simple blob goblin as the first 2 felt like they would make more fitting D&amp;D art). I then found some reference poses, sketched out that wireframe, tripled the frame and drew the same pose 3 times. Times 2 as I did the exercise twice.</p>
<p>The first one was my fave little grumpy guy. I’m very in love with his huge lower jaw. The second guy has great years and a very simple face that looked good on everything. The 3rd one is me taking my favourite parts of the first two and trying to create something new.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/wap-6.4-1906bd805637be2448d613144c7e8f86.jpg" width="2400" height="1600" class="img_wQsy"></p>
<p>Found a middle ground for the ears, mouth from one, nose from the other. Clothing ended up being a bit of a combo and I still don’t love it but this wasn’t a clothing challenge so I let it slide for the exercise.</p>
<p>Overall I’m happy with my 3rd form guy. While it doesn’t feel like the most unique thing in the world, I knew that once I took this design into day 5 I would likely start to deviate even further from my references.</p>
<p>Reference: Grumpy goblin: This one was impossible to find due to the internet being flooded with Baby Yoda art. After a long Instagram scroll I can confirm it’s by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/camkendell/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">camkendell.</a></p>

<p>I didn’t go into day 5 with only imagination, I let myself keep a tab of “action poses” open for this week. Poses wasn’t my area of study for the week and I didn’t want to waste too much time troubleshooting poses when what I was really focused on was character design.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/wap-6.5-aba213baee7072d3e90da19cdf93c1fe.jpg" width="2400" height="1299" class="img_wQsy"></p>
<p>I’m pretty happy with how the goblin guys turned out! The central design didn’t changes too much but I have started to second guess the big ears. I’m also struggling with how to handle the large mouth from multiple angles so that might be a long term project. Playing around with expression would also be fun.</p>

<p>With our iPad being on life support I returned to my Huion and I think I’m really coming around to sketching with it. I’ve warmed up to the default CSP pencils and now really like how they make sketches look.</p>
<p>While there was the extra struggle this week of having to alter the daily programming, I feel like I landed somewhere near typical character design. I could have played with shape language more, and pushed things harder on clothing and expressions but still trying to keep these daily practices fairly focused to avoid feeling overwhelmed.</p>
<p>This week I even spent time inking and colouring one of my practice guys from day 4 instead of day 5 because I was already pretty happy which what I was producing.</p>

<p>Next week I’ll return to a more traditional subject: rabbits.</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Week 5 - Hair styles]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is another week where I wanted to push the boundaries of the format. A large part of drawing practice is to get more ideas into your head, basically to build a shape library. So my goal with this week’s focus was twofold: broaden my mental library of hair styles and also find ways to convey hairstyles as minimally as possible.</p>
<p>After 5 days of it, I’m not sure how I feel.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_FNw8" id="day-1---drawing-from-imagination">Day 1 - Drawing from imagination<a href="https://kymira.ca/blog/wap-5#day-1---drawing-from-imagination" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Day 1 - Drawing from imagination" title="Direct link to Day 1 - Drawing from imagination">​</a></h2>
<p>Day 1 as usual was pretty messy. Put down some vague head shapes and attempted to think of hair styles I know. This day is always a little difficult because you come up against the blank page of your mind. The classic moment of “have I even seen hair before?” when you try to mentally form an image in your head.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/wap-5.1-940858b51635b0ae1de2cfcc30bac292.jpg" width="2857" height="1512" class="img_wQsy"></p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_FNw8" id="day-2---figure-sketching">Day 2 - Figure sketching<a href="https://kymira.ca/blog/wap-5#day-2---figure-sketching" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Day 2 - Figure sketching" title="Direct link to Day 2 - Figure sketching">​</a></h2>
<p>Day 2 went a little better, the gift of being able to look at references. But this leads to falling into the hair trap: Drawing too many lines.</p>
<p>I’ve done hair tutorials before, I know that for drawing detailed hair you want to break it down into sections and try to just draw those sections, add minimal individual strands at the end to add a few fly aways or play with the shape. I find this very hard to do when working from a photo reference as hair is so messy. And the more time I spend on them the more lines I keep adding.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Quick hand sketches using references" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/wap-5.2-1088cc8b89dccf4beaebfd8a99441f6f.jpg" width="2885" height="1496" class="img_wQsy"></p>

<p>This day is supposed to be spending more time with the photo references but that just means adding more strands and making more of a mess :’) I’m not sure why this week feels like it’s going so bad but I’m starting to feel like hair styles may have been too big of a topic. I possibly could have tried a sub theme, like up-dos or long or lose hair. By just trying to do a large variety of hair styles I didn’t feel like I could focus on learning a few tricks to pull off something specific.</p>

<p>When choosing styles to study I very much focused on simplified cartoon styles. Stayed away from over the top anime styles and didn’t want anything super realistic. But I worry this has led to almost too much simplification and I’d like to find a style somewhere in the middle.</p>
<p>I tried using only forward facing faces for this day to make myself think of the hair style from a slightly different but consistent angle.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/wap-5.4.1-79ad5e2141023af9b68753531d01a351.jpg" width="2732" height="2048" class="img_wQsy"></p>

<p>I think this is the middle ground cartoon style I like most. But when looking at these a lot of the bangs and overall styles were a little too un-realistic to me. The artist does say they were exploring futuristic hairstyles so I don't think they are supposed to be the most realistic styles out there.</p>

<p>This is probably the most simplified style out of all of them. Mostly just the exterior lines to show the shape of the hair.</p>
<p>Reference: This is my first full failure to find a reference source. This image has been pinned on Pinterest so many times I can't find a non-Pinterest source. One source was a video so it might be from a TikTok????</p>

<p>While I often feel a little bit of fear on day 5, this is the time I probably feared it the most. Partially because I didn’t feel like I had any big insightful moments during my reference or style study days. And additionally because I didn’t come up with a way to make the “final project” more engaging than drawing shapes on mannequin heads. So I did a few sheets.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/wap-5.5.1-1400d6637c53e2b810209cb76fc7c3ea.jpg" width="2710" height="3097" class="img_wQsy"></p>
<p>These left me feeling rather underwhelmed so I stopped for the day and let myself ruminate on it for a little longer. The next day I sat down and tried to do something a little more directed, which led to you getting to play a Guess That Hair game.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/tng_hair-93405af9f2bf6e8b19409ce74686c30e.jpg" width="2227" height="1508" class="img_wQsy"></p>
<p>I did look at references for this as the challenge wasn’t just to draw hair but to get it close enough to be able to guess the character just by the hair style. While I don’t feel like this is an overly impressive piece by any means, I am happy that they are all clear to me at a glance. So while I don’t feel confident in my mental library of hair styles I do feel like I’ve found some confidence in translating hair styles into a simplified art style.</p>

<p>I think my lesson for this week is that not all subjects can be covered in a week. While I kind of came to the same conclusion with hands I at least felt like I made progress there while with hair I feel like I just scratched the surface. My biggest takeaway is that I really enjoyed drawing coily hair, it has such a great shape and variety to it.</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A few pieces completed in January]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The weekly art practice posts are taking up a large portion of my creative time but I’m still working on other pieces alongside them. A classic instance of the more time you spend doing a hobby the more you want to do it. The near daily art practice is helping me feel “warmed up” most days, I don’t feel like I need to ease into art every time I want to start something new now. Still rather shocked at how much I’m making.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_FNw8" id="courses">Courses<a href="https://kymira.ca/blog/january-extras#courses" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Courses" title="Direct link to Courses">​</a></h2>
<p>Courses aren’t my big focus for this year but I’ve done 2 small little focused things so far.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_FNw8" id="domestika-course-illustrating-fantastical-animals-with-procreate">Domestika course: Illustrating Fantastical Animals with Procreate<a href="https://kymira.ca/blog/january-extras#domestika-course-illustrating-fantastical-animals-with-procreate" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Domestika course: Illustrating Fantastical Animals with Procreate" title="Direct link to Domestika course: Illustrating Fantastical Animals with Procreate">​</a></h3>
<p><a href="https://www.domestika.org/en/courses/3163-illustrating-fantastical-animals-with-procreate" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Julia Körner</a> is an artist I found on Instagram and saw she had a Domestika course. This was one of the main things that tempted me into a Domestika subscription. I was curious to see what went into her pieces that made them so soft and light.</p>
<p>The course ended up being a pretty typical “follow-along” of the kinds I had done a bunch of on 21Draw. The key takeaways being what kind of brushes an artist uses to get their effects and how do they texture or use light. I attempted to follow her flow when working on this piece of a kobold submarine captain from my current D&amp;D campaign.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="An orange kobold holding a large wrench" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/esior-cacf2261e64e2e87983b935ded2c553c.jpg" width="1895" height="2021" class="img_wQsy"></p>
<p>I’m decently happy with how this one came together, used a few shading techniques that I don’t often do and I like how soft everything looks in the end. Though I can’t say I feel like I have any confidence in being able to draw any more like Körner does by the end of the course. Her unique approach to animals is still very goals.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_FNw8" id="live-drawclass">Live Drawclass<a href="https://kymira.ca/blog/january-extras#live-drawclass" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Live Drawclass" title="Direct link to Live Drawclass">​</a></h3>
<p>I’ve shared a link to a Drawfee Drawclass before, this time I upgraded my Patreon tier and followed one live. The videos are usually posted a month or so after they happen so this one on Character Design should be on YouTube soon.</p>
<p>I was a little disappointed that there wasn’t a clear process or steps explained as I’m a very steps oriented person. Just throwing stuff down or working through multiple ideas isn’t something that helps me focus. But it was still helpful to listen for the two hours and try to apply what was being talked about to my own sketches during the class time.</p>
<p>I tried out Jacob’s first character in a different pose and then simply copied the face he drew. He started with the idea of “tired eyes” which is something I hadn’t tried before so I just wanted to see if I could pull off the same look.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/drawclass1-08e2ed3064e853a98e1ef2fef7d9901f.jpg" width="4080" height="2405" class="img_wQsy"></p>
<p>In the second part I tried to approach the prompt on my own. A plucky sidekick for the first character.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/drawclass2-d1247745384023dc7bb82eff52443e7e.jpg" width="1941" height="1468" class="img_wQsy"></p>

<p>This is a digital re-draw of a piece I did probably 3-4 years ago now. I decided to use them as a character in my current underwater D&amp;D campaign. I had them planned for a year before even starting the campaign, and I knew I wanted a new version of the piece to show the players for when the reveal would happen. It took almost a year of running the campaign before I even got to that reveal and I still didn’t finish this piece 2 months before I shared it in game.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="A drider hiding behind a large colourful crystal." src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/yirrekeb-ecc3c68562ab9c5e6d99fc560e3f9e08.jpg" width="2020" height="2048" class="img_wQsy"></p>

<p>These were a headache. I had tried learning vector art many months ago now and failed to produce anything I was happy with. In my first attempt I was trying to re-create icons I had drawn in a regular art program. These ended up being too detailed and had too many colours to keep the svg format happy. I got frustrated and gave up on them.</p>
<p>This time around I was going to go in fresh. Which meant finding/learning a new program that would do svgs and choosing new ideas. I ended up using Linearity Curve for the iPad and it wasn’t terrible. It even had a “covert to vector”-like feature that you could do to any image. I did this for one royalty free squirrel photo I found, which became icon number one. Then I traced over messy sketches for squirrel 2 and the crow.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/3icons-41cb415b208ca8285baa9026f7fef2f8.jpg" width="1600" height="551" class="img_wQsy"></p>
<p>I probably should have done 3 squirrels or something to better convey what each section is but I wasn’t loving the process. Maybe someday I’ll revisit vectors but they just really aren’t my speed.</p>]]></content>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Week 4 - Hands]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Honestly surprised that this is 4 for 4 this month. Maybe I can do a blog post every week. Though I suspect committing to extremely minimal social time for January and my workplace being a disaster has contributed to having enough time to pull it off.</p>
<p>Anyway, I hope you like looking at hands. I don’t find them as exciting as pigeons or squirrels but after a few weeks of easy-ish creatures I wanted to try something that would be a serious push. And which would be applicable to more art pieces. I have an animation I’ve been working on that’s taken twice as long because of how much time I’ve spent fighting with the hands. Ended up going with a very blob like shape in the end just to keep making progress. Time to see if a week of hands can carry me through drawing more hands in the future.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_FNw8" id="day-1---drawing-from-imagination">Day 1 - Drawing from imagination<a href="https://kymira.ca/blog/wap-4#day-1---drawing-from-imagination" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Day 1 - Drawing from imagination" title="Direct link to Day 1 - Drawing from imagination">​</a></h2>
<p>The first thing I noticed about this week is that it’s difficult to draw hands <em>without</em> a reference. They are right there, doing the work, you can’t look away. I tried my best to not do any posing or staring at my hands for too long in hopes of forcing my brain to think of the shapes itself.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Rough hand sketches in a notebook." src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/wap-4.1-2e4ca6b930d7a0a85541725f75657781.jpg" width="2953" height="1745" class="img_wQsy"></p>

<p>Day two I gave myself more freedom to look at local hands while also using some references.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Quick hand sketches using references" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/wap-4.2-377f467d1cb69ad5ec263f7a6ed17cf1.jpg" width="2178" height="1264" class="img_wQsy"></p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_FNw8" id="day-3---reference-drawing">Day 3 - Reference Drawing<a href="https://kymira.ca/blog/wap-4#day-3---reference-drawing" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Day 3 - Reference Drawing" title="Direct link to Day 3 - Reference Drawing">​</a></h2>
<p>Now with more serious references in play, I’ve come to the conclusion that we shouldn’t render hands too much. When you start looking at the specific details and shapes fingers make in photos, they sometimes translate terribly when putting them to paper. There’s also just so many wrinkles and curves that it’s easy for a hand to become muddy very quickly.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/wap-4.3.1-e4fef44f3e8277db3e6c31ea6b246f57.jpg" width="2732" height="2048" class="img_wQsy"></p>
<p>There were 9 hands here but I just went with one or else this could have been the only reference image I needed. Thumb up seemed like a nice starting point. Keep most of the fingers partially hidden.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/wap-4.3.2-d3388791cf892d063bec66a9b1f760a9.jpg" width="2732" height="2048" class="img_wQsy"></p>
<p>Fingers coming towards the camera has always been a weakness of mine. I find it very difficult to convey the depth in a hand so that each finger is still readable.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/wap-4.3.3-71c0ee932ee13848e674d2a9660e36fa.jpg" width="2732" height="2048" class="img_wQsy"></p>
<p>Another coming towards the camera one, proof I was trying to challenge myself. This hand is one of the ones that helped me see how strangely angular hands can be.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/wap-4.3.4-94275265888f871c7760b994876e1c9a.jpg" width="2732" height="2048" class="img_wQsy"></p>
<p>And then holding a ball. Often if I’m doing a character drawing the character is often holding or touching something so object interaction is a pretty important shape to practise for me.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_FNw8" id="day-4---style-study">Day 4 - Style study<a href="https://kymira.ca/blog/wap-4#day-4---style-study" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Day 4 - Style study" title="Direct link to Day 4 - Style study">​</a></h2>
<p>After my conclusion of “too much detail = bad” I was excited to get some ideas for simple approaches. I’m often drawing hands on small characters where the hand isn’t the focus but is often trying to communicate something. I just need enough details for it to be clear what kind of action the hand is doing.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/wap-4.4.1-03362d697241d89b0d3ad3980973bd9a.jpg" width="2732" height="2048" class="img_wQsy"></p>
<p>Started with fingers. Seems to make sense to start with the small part of a bigger object. I’m pretty familiar with the tube or sausages approach to drawing fingers but this was the first time I saw it done with a variety of perspectives.</p>

<p>I enjoy the box breakdown of hands, really helps to keep the 3D shape of the hand. But as I worked on these I did start to feel like they were too realistic to really be a style study.</p>

<p>Now here are some hands that really embrace the angular-ness of fingers! Each finger looks so strong and expressive. But look at them the wrong way and I get confused at what I’m looking at.</p>

<p>I fell in love with this style. So sleek and simple but so expressive. The lines are easy to draw after a few tries and it just felt good. I didn’t commit to carrying this style through all my other practices but it’s definitely something filed away in my mind now.</p>

<p>I caught this one last minute on Pinterest right before I started my drawing session. It was a style different from the other 2 previous ones, more cartoony, which was very much something I wanted to try. Just get even simpler but also rounder and cuter. It makes the hands stand out less but possibly easier to execute.</p>
<p>I was enjoying these so I took some photos and tried to adapt those poses with the style.</p>

<p>Test day. After my coloured pigeon piece from last week I decided that I wanted to do something like that as a final project of sorts for each theme. So I started day 5’s drawing time with some sketches, mostly trying to capture the styles that I had practiced the day before.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/wap-4.5.1-e67a18cff67a77437c469aa2d7ba144d.jpg" width="2732" height="2048" class="img_wQsy"></p>
<p>Then I wanted to do something a little more detailed. Something that could be part of a larger piece where maybe the focus of the illustration is on the hands.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/wap-4.5.2-30018dd9d4554e12712f9b34787288cc.jpg" width="2219" height="1709" class="img_wQsy"></p>
<p>My girlfriend says this looks like a tattoo design and after she said it I could see it. Add a bit more ling definition to the flame and it could be a weird clavicle piece.</p>

<p>It will get tedious to keep saying “I’m shocked at how much 4 days of practice does!” it does still feel like that every day 5. I honestly enjoy drawing hands but do find it difficult. I think a big part of learning from this week was once again to embrace very simplified styles. And maybe adopt a drawing approach of continuous practice…</p>
<p>I’m happy that this week wasn’t as hard as I feared. It didn’t feel overly difficult compared to the creatures from before. And having pages full of floating hands looks pretty cool.</p>
<p>Later today I’m attending an online art lesson on the character design process by one of the Drawfee hosts, so I might have a project to blog about from that. I also have a few other fully coloured pieces from the last few months that I haven’t included anywhere. And my attempts at vector art to be the new icons for this site. So I may have multiple posts over the next few weeks. While also trying to prepare and participate in Funguary again.</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Week 3 - Pigeons]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Another week of having a good amount of time to devote to art. Huion tablet setup is reliable once more and now I don’t need to fight with making sure the pressure settings are working every time I turn it on.</p>
<p>Pigeons are the 3rd most common creature on our back patio so this is a creature a see regularly, unlike the pangolin. Love to see him, love when they awkwardly try to cling to the trellis.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_FNw8" id="day-1---drawing-from-imagination">Day 1 - Drawing from imagination<a href="https://kymira.ca/blog/wap-3#day-1---drawing-from-imagination" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Day 1 - Drawing from imagination" title="Direct link to Day 1 - Drawing from imagination">​</a></h2>
<p>Day one wasn’t too intimidating. The hardest part is trying to not fall into the habits of drawing other birds. I drew a lot of birds of prey as a kid but pigeons have very little in common with raptors. So I find myself struggling with their longer necks and small beaks.</p>
<p>My pigeons ended up looking more like chickens.</p>

<p>As usual I think I’m maybe spending too much time on these. I need to get better at setting a timer to limit myself to 2-3 minutes per reference or else I fall into doing more fully reference sketches.</p>

<p>It’s hard to resist just drawing pigeons in ball form. Love when they bury their head in their big neck and poof up. But I managed to resist and try a few other poses. I also tried to play around a bit with colour here but didn’t want that to be a big focus.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/wap-3.3.1-9fcdfe2214aa37d77b6249ff0eefcd89.jpg" width="2400" height="1600" class="img_wQsy"></p>
<p>Simple start, standing in profile. Probably could have spent more time on this one but I tend to start fast and then slowly put more time into each reference practice piece.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/wap-3.3.2-cc8ab76e7f6b9033766ad5bbf82d04ae.jpg" width="2400" height="1600" class="img_wQsy"></p>
<p>The prettiest pigeon! While I have focused on rock doves for my reference I chose this one for it’s more unique pose and colours.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/wap-3.3.3-737250ecd50b1cde78f8925ffea69664.jpg" width="2400" height="1600" class="img_wQsy"></p>
<p>Fluff! Fluff! As much as I love them I struggle to make them round enough. Need to “push the pose” when the pose is “be a circle”.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/wap-3.3.4-7a68ab9d10651fd8f86391c18690e50b.jpg" width="2400" height="1600" class="img_wQsy"></p>
<p>Wings are still a challenge when you don’t want to draw 100 feathers but also don’t want to do an empty block shape.</p>

<p>There are a lot of good stylized pigeons out there. I try to choose a variety of them to see some different approaches. Thankfully pigeons aren’t super complicated body-wise, but I feel like it’s still hard to capture their cute-ness.
<img loading="lazy" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/wap-3.4.1-74962da63d5a1cd675b5f71d26b0675a.jpg" width="2400" height="1600" class="img_wQsy"></p>
<p>Some nice simple guys here. They make the pigeon feel a little more fluid.</p>

<p>Such confident shapes! I feel like this one really helped nail down the simplified shapes going on.</p>

<p>I love when pigeons are balls. This one just felt very expressive with a very simple shape. I made the beak too large on mine but I still find it very cute. I don’t have the instinct to add the little shiver lines like on the top of this guy but it adds so much on the original.</p>

<p>These guys have great personalities and good weird shapes. They’re a little outside my comfort style zone so definitely felt like a stretch.</p>

<p>I of course went for a round guy for my final test day. But I felt like this first one was a little too sketch-y to be my final piece for the week.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/wap-3.5.1-3ed2d5d1cc9687284849a7267286007f.jpg" width="2400" height="1600" class="img_wQsy"></p>
<p>I decided to go for a more stylized one with proper line art and some sort of colour approach.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/wap-3.5.2-f335ef1c3da6523f10b575067fe68640.jpg" width="2400" height="1600" class="img_wQsy"></p>
<p>I found it weirdly difficult to make up my mind about soft colours and hard colours here. Ended up with the soft blend on the neck feathers and then the harder greys on the wings. I don’t love the combo but I didn’t like when the neck colours were hard edged. But otherwise, kind of pleased with this guy.</p>

<p>Now that I’ve done 3 weeks of animals I’m going to try working on some smaller focus things for a few weeks.</p>
<p>Time for a real artist challenge: Hands. Not sure how this one will go. But hoping to gain some hand confidence.</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Week 2 is pangolins]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A wild week at work resulted in me spending most of my evenings trying not to think about it by drawing. So here are a bunch of sketches of pangolins.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_FNw8" id="day-1---drawing-from-imagination">Day 1 - Drawing from imagination<a href="https://kymira.ca/blog/wap-2#day-1---drawing-from-imagination" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Day 1 - Drawing from imagination" title="Direct link to Day 1 - Drawing from imagination">​</a></h2>
<p>Since day 1 is drawing from imagination I didn’t want to look at a single reference image before starting. This resulted in a funny mistake.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Messy pangolin sketches." src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/wap-2.1-f3bf864a06f40808808a4ed1efefadaa.jpg" width="3063" height="1886" class="img_wQsy"></p>
<p>I had a moment early on, of asking myself, do pangolins have ears that poke out? I didn’t want to break the assignment by looking at a reference so I gave them little poky ears… which was wrong.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_FNw8" id="day-2---figure-sketching">Day 2 - Figure sketching<a href="https://kymira.ca/blog/wap-2#day-2---figure-sketching" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Day 2 - Figure sketching" title="Direct link to Day 2 - Figure sketching">​</a></h2>
<p>I was able to correct my mental image of pangolins on day 2. These quick sketches reinforced my thinking that these guys have a similar build to squirrels in a few ways. They have the same triangle-ish arms, smaller chest zone big butt zone, long tails. But even with those similarities I feel like they give off very different vibes.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Quick pangolin sketches using references" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/wap-2.2-b682b36835920cbab8f5398b186a3a55.jpg" width="3072" height="1969" class="img_wQsy"></p>

<p>I really like day 3. Having an image up and scrutinising it for the mistakes I made in the first 2 days feels like the learning coming together. However this is also when I get torn about being more detail oriented (draw all the armour scales) and skipping over that because it’s not the most educational in these exercises but is fun.</p>

<p>Having seen a few stylizing pangolins in the wild previously I knew I could get some good variety here. I tried to choose some of the more stylized versions to learn from. Especially when it comes to different approaches to doing the scales.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Vector art simplified pangolins." src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/wap-2.4.1-ad65375ffcb05e90cf6e5886772d7079.jpg" width="1893" height="1350" class="img_wQsy"></p>
<p>These guys got simplified down to zig zag patterns which is pretty good. Though I don’t love how it makes them look so smooth.</p>

<p>These guys have just the hint of triangles to convey where the scales would be. I feel like this is a nice compromise when working with simple shapes or a limited colour palette or size.</p>

<p>These ones were pretty normal and I didn’t want to spend all my time drawing on the scales so I moved on.</p>

<p>Then this guy is mostly just has shapes thrown down to hint at the repetition and presence of the scales.</p>

<p>This second time around felt less test-like than week one. This time the struggle was pangolin poses. While I felt like I had spent the week getting their shape down I didn’t really spend enough time watching them move about. Squirrels I see every day, I get them. Pangolins are pretty mysteries. So I felt a little limited by my ability to imagine them in a variety of poses.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Four digital pangolin sketches." src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/wap-2.5-811c628c109444138071e295c40497b8.jpg" width="1959" height="1242" class="img_wQsy"></p>
<p>I do at least like them, I think these pieces are still cute and do look like pangolins. But the movement and idea of looking at videos alongside still images is a good takeaway for creatures moving forward.</p>

<p>Week 2 felt like it went pretty smoothly. And that’s with the hiccup of sending our iPad in for repairs. So this week's digital sketches were done on my Huion tablet that I set up for the first time in 3 years. This meant a little bit of adjustment time and tech troubleshooting before I could get to my daily practice. Slowed me down a bit but should now be prepared to survive without the iPad for a week.</p>
<p>Now to prep for week 3: Pigeons</p>
