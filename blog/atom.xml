        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Progress in my first week of participating in NaNoRenO]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Week 1 of NaNoRenO is over, so time for a re-cap of what I could get through this week. This will definitely contain spoilers, I guess?? But also the game is completely in flux so who knows what a real spoiler is.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_FNw8" id="renpy">Ren’py<a href="https://kymira.ca/blog/nanoreno1#renpy" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Ren’py" title="Direct link to Ren’py">​</a></h2>
<p>My biggest game “mechanic” that I wanted to be able to incorporate was randomising the order of scenes a player could get. It ended up being easy enough to find other people asking for example how to do this. So I took some code samples shared in a forum and started to experiment with how to use it. So far so good, now I just need to not get lost in it while filling in the content.</p>
<p>Something I don’t love about Ren’py is that it seems like the bulk of the game is in a single file. It will probably make it easier to hunt for errors in the future but I’m very worried about how messy the file will get.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_FNw8" id="backgrounds">Backgrounds<a href="https://kymira.ca/blog/nanoreno1#backgrounds" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Backgrounds" title="Direct link to Backgrounds">​</a></h2>
<p>My main focus for the week was backgrounds. With the second day being troubleshooting why my image isn't filling the screen properly. Spent a fair bit of time researching why this could happen only to finally find that it was my own Clip Studio Paint save setting that was re-sizing the output. Oops. Which is why at the end of day one this was all the progress I had to show.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Quick sketches using references" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/day1-9690de712c4ebb62d9e37ed498b55b1a.png" width="1718" height="993" class="img_wQsy"></p>
<p>With that solved I spent each day trying to complete one background. As of today I have 6, having taken 2 days easy after longer work days. So I’m pretty happy about that. It’s nearly 50% of the backgrounds I had planned for.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="A collection of 5 background images." src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/week1-bgs-2d0d5a96a1860282b11b8cec2ea669bf.jpg" width="1600" height="1300" class="img_wQsy"></p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_FNw8" id="planning">Planning<a href="https://kymira.ca/blog/nanoreno1#planning" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Planning" title="Direct link to Planning">​</a></h2>
<p>I had done my original game flow layout before the month started (which you are allowed to do!). I had originally planned to make the first prototype of this game in Twine so I had that downloaded and ready to go. I’m more familiar with Twine so I used it to lay down the main beats/scenes as well as the progression path. Which resulted in this:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Screenshot of Twine boxes" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/scene-flow-18030958df0a3a9ad94993d405d7ef75.png" width="1390" height="1042" class="img_wQsy"></p>
<p>This is what helped me count how many backgrounds I would need and how many scenes I would have to write.</p>
<p>I’ve only written a few lines so far, I should really start getting other ideas down. But I have confidence in my writing speed and less confidence in my drawing speed so the creation of the assets is my biggest priority while I still have new project excitement.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_FNw8" id="conclusion">Conclusion<a href="https://kymira.ca/blog/nanoreno1#conclusion" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Conclusion" title="Direct link to Conclusion">​</a></h2>
<p>I do feel my desire for drawing backgrounds already waning. But buying new brushes and finding ways to “cheat” a look I want to do still feels nice. In some places, like the fence in the garden scene, I tried to find a fence brush that would help me spit that out in a second. But after trying 3 or 4 I gave up and drew one segment then repeated it. For the ropes in the outdoor lighthouse scene that was an easy brush to find so I could just do 2 lines then done. So there is a bit of a treasure hunt quality to some of the tasks which I enjoy. Found a water reflection brush that I feel like works really well so I’m no longer afraid to fill the space on large bodies of water.</p>
<p>The indoor scenes though, yikes.</p>
<p>I did a fair bit of research into lighthouses before I started (and still am really). But there are very few images of the inside of lighthouses. And these days when you try to research them, what you’re going to find is remodelled lighthouses turned into Air B&amp;Bs. Which is very much not what I’m looking for.</p>
<p>So with indoor scenes being a weakness and having basically zero reference images to work from, I’m afraid these rooms are going to look rather wild as I continue to draw more of them. I’m proud of the desk scene at least. That’s the first image in the game so I wanted to at least not hate it. While a few of the backgrounds I’ve done I do hate already. But we only have a month so can’t dwell on trying to fix them, it’s on to the next image.</p>]]></content>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Week 9 - Trees]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Spending a week on trees is kind of a weird one. It’s pretty rare that I would want to draw a singular tree, more often I’d be wanting to draw a forest as part of a landscape or some simple background shapes where the tree isn’t one of the pain focal points. But I still wanted to do this week to spend time looking at West Coast trees and try to find ways to quickly construct trees that I could possibly re-use for the NaNoRenO project.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_FNw8" id="day-1---drawing-from-imagination">Day 1 - Drawing from imagination<a href="https://kymira.ca/blog/wap-9#day-1---drawing-from-imagination" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Day 1 - Drawing from imagination" title="Direct link to Day 1 - Drawing from imagination">​</a></h2>
<p>It’s pretty easy to mentally bring up an image of a tree, but even my mental image of a tree is way more simplified than what a tree actually looks like. It’s easy to think of triangle pin trees, or apple trees that are mostly just a green circle for the leaves and then a trunk. Trying to be realistic mostly feels like drawing leaves and branches until you get tired of it.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/wap-9.1-be09459b9375e1293427784130d96c84.jpg" width="2265" height="1218" class="img_wQsy"></p>
<p>I did take a stab at some non-local tree types that were in my head from preparing my reference photos the day before. There are some very interesting trees out there.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_FNw8" id="day-2---figure-sketching">Day 2 - Figure sketching<a href="https://kymira.ca/blog/wap-9#day-2---figure-sketching" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Day 2 - Figure sketching" title="Direct link to Day 2 - Figure sketching">​</a></h2>
<p>Tried to make myself speed up for figure sketching this week. It worked for the first three, mostly just laying down shapes. After that I spent more time thinking about the smaller parts of the tree and wanting to give them more detail as the first 3 felt like messy blobs.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Quick sketches using references" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/wap-9.2-2127aef8068c95dfabf690327fd33d61.jpg" width="1941" height="1386" class="img_wQsy"></p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_FNw8" id="day-3---reference-studies">Day 3 - Reference studies<a href="https://kymira.ca/blog/wap-9#day-3---reference-studies" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Day 3 - Reference studies" title="Direct link to Day 3 - Reference studies">​</a></h2>
<p>It was a little strange to do reference studies since I know my goal for the end of the week isn’t to replicate trees exactly. At this point I started to play around with brushes to lay down leaves faster, using the reference mostly for shape.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/wap-9.3-a8fb03e89c19cd10347ea006262d8b53.jpg" width="3072" height="1728" class="img_wQsy"></p>
<p>I did multiple pine trees because I knew I’d be drawing a lot of them in March. These were pretty simple in that I just tried out 3 different brushes to act as the pine needles. Then on the more detailed one I just tried hand drawing a bunch of branches. Which didn’t actually take too long in the end.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_FNw8" id="day-4---style-studies">Day 4 - Style studies<a href="https://kymira.ca/blog/wap-9#day-4---style-studies" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Day 4 - Style studies" title="Direct link to Day 4 - Style studies">​</a></h2>
<p>There were a lot of different styles I wanted to spend time on but it could have been a project for the whole week. First I tried some of the vector styles that I had tried a bit when doing lighthouses &amp; landscape week. And then a more cartoon-y style that I like a lot for it’s flow.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/wap-9.4.1-e8c5ff7d1fd983da37b6901c7be1bbf1.jpg" width="3072" height="1728" class="img_wQsy"></p>

<p>Then I tried for some watercolours but remembered the watercolour brushes I like are on Procreate and not in Clip. So I don’t feel like I was able to really re-create the right style there. But I like the originals and may pursue them on paper someday.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/wap-9.4.2-33a9658608b4d571d7a4ac0a1144f9be.jpg" width="3072" height="1728" class="img_wQsy"></p>

<p>Then I wanted to do a more painterly one. I liked how blocky this one was and used some new square brushes that I was finally able to find. Pretty happy with this vibe but don’t feel like it’s a great fit for trying to draw a whole forest.</p>

<p>There were a lot of tree styles I liked so I attempted to do a variety of them from memory. The vector type, the take it slow type, and a block-y painting type.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/wap-9.5-c99c8f56d7f815340997b9a9be31b7cc.jpg" width="3072" height="1728" class="img_wQsy"></p>

<p>I don’t feel like I have strong takeaways from this week except for the new found curiosity to keep exploring other styles. I wasn’t expecting trees to have so much variety but I guess since they are one of the most common elements to a nature scene they are re-produced constantly. So I can see re-visiting trees in the future as there are more on my Pinterest board I’d like to experiment with.</p>
<p>With NaNoRenO starting today I’m thinking of putting my Weekly Art Practice work on pause while I focus on all the art pieces needed for the VN. Got a few scene sketches started today, a meer fraction of the work ahead for the planned project. But I’ll probably keep to weekly blogging just with sharing game progress instead of practice progress.</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Week 8 - Lighthouses and landscapes]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This week is another alternate take on the format. With the plan to do NaNoRenO in March, I know I’ll need to draw a look of backgrounds in a short amount of time. The game I’ve been ruminating on is set around a lighthouse which would mean a lot of outdoor shots and probably some establishing landscape shots. These have never been a strength of mine so I wanted to spend a week trying to figure out a style that would work for both:</p>
<ol>
<li>The vibe of the game</li>
<li>Could be executed quickly</li>
</ol>
<p>This leads to trying to find the right balance of detailing. I attempted to try out a few different approaches to this, taking lots of inspiration from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dkX9Ul6kywM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jacob Drawfee's “I made myself draw backgrounds every day for a week”</a>. While also trying to remember the main take aways from the <a href="https://www.kymira.ca/blog/landscapes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">landscape course</a> I did last year.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_FNw8" id="day-1---drawing-from-imagination">Day 1 - Drawing from imagination<a href="https://kymira.ca/blog/wap-8#day-1---drawing-from-imagination" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Day 1 - Drawing from imagination" title="Direct link to Day 1 - Drawing from imagination">​</a></h2>
<p>Day 1 was the usual attempt to draw from imagination. I did some quick sketches to try to just think about composition and maybe about the kind of view I wanted to have for the game.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Sketchbook sketches of coastlines" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/wap-8.1-abb5d3e13d5a49814dbafce61b1ea84c.jpg" width="1630" height="2829" class="img_wQsy"></p>
<p>I also did some digital attempts on day 1 because I had the time. I tried to limit each one to an hour, focusing on laying down blocks and colours.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Steven Universe inspired style of coastlines" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/wap-8.1.2-158d54db4bf4ae7000ab80410fd6f813.jpg" width="3134" height="2233" class="img_wQsy"></p>
<p>Keep these first attempts in mind as we move through the next ones.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_FNw8" id="day-2---testing-styles">Day 2 - Testing styles<a href="https://kymira.ca/blog/wap-8#day-2---testing-styles" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Day 2 - Testing styles" title="Direct link to Day 2 - Testing styles">​</a></h2>
<p>I had gathered up a lot of different stylized landscapes for the week, a lot of them ended up being this kind of vector style which I do find rather quick to execute. For the first piece I just tried to copy the vibe without vectors to see if I could keep it so clean.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Vector landscape studies" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/wap-8.2.1-cd9f142c8d3f9ab1a65528635113c23e.jpg" width="1133" height="753" class="img_wQsy"></p>

<p>Then I chose a reference image and tried out a few more painterly + cartoon style. I didn’t love this and it felt like it sucked up a lot of time with little reward.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Painting studies." src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/wap-8.2.2-4696e021db3772f164f28f33bb4b3ab1.jpg" width="2748" height="1173" class="img_wQsy"></p>

<p>Now we’re into style practices. This first one is an image I really loved when I saw it. I have a high suspicion that it’s AI created and now I’m wondering if I should just spend my live re-drawing AI art. In this instance I changed it up by replacing the cabin with a lighthouse.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/wap-8.3-f800c94dec7af4a00874dd1a5873a4c0.jpg" width="1471" height="1474" class="img_wQsy"></p>
<p>This piece took somewhere from 3-4 hours. Not ideal but I am pretty pleased with it. I found ways to speed it up and also found some brushes for texture I really liked as well.</p>

<p>I gave myself an extra practice day this week since there was so much I wanted to cover. This time I was working from a photograph again.</p>
<p>For the first I wanted to try to be slightly more detailed but still kind of simple blocks for the buildings. The field is a bit of a trap in that you can spend so much time trying to detail grass and flowers. I could see myself enjoying this but it wasn’t the focus of the piece and I don’t think I’ll be drawing many grass fields next month.</p>

<p>For the extra day I wanted to try another simple looking style. A little bit like a comic or graphic novel. Flat colours and maybe more detailed line work. I also like this as a style but we’ll see in my final test how I’m going to struggle to really adapt it to my west coast inspired scenery.</p>

<p>For this last challenge I time boxed myself to 1 hour to see how far I could get in that amount of time. I wanted to prioritise the kind of flat colours style from the previous challenge while using some of the vector tricks to add depth or texture in the distance.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/wap-8.5-56c63e9d8f327e1f843edaffa51e95e7.jpg" width="3072" height="1728" class="img_wQsy"></p>
<p>It does feel like with another hour I could get to something I like. Though I’m not sure if this style is really what I want for the project. I just feel like I’d like a little more texture. Working in some watercolour techniques might be my next exercises.</p>

<p>This was a fun week but it was also very time consuming. For most of the piece I put in 2-3 hours every day into working on something. Which is more time than I had planned to devote to art practice every week. But it also felt good to work on things outside my comfort zone again.</p>
<p>Next week is going to be a slightly complimentary exercise, but on a much smaller scope. I want to try to just draw a bunch of trees.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This week we’re back in my comfort zone; drawing creatures.</p>

<p>Day 1 felt decently smooth. Rabbit’s aren’t the most complicated creatures and I feel like I see them in images on a regular basis (unlike pangolins).</p>

<p>I feel like I keep giving myself more and more time for the day 2 practice but I really need to start forcing myself to limit how much time I spend on each sketch. It’s just nice to stare at cute bunnies.</p>

<p>Day 3 spent analysing the inner bean shape of rabbits, smaller chest area, larger hide quarters and face slightly similar to a squirrel but like a soft sided triangle. A decent amount of squirrel similarities really. But rounder.</p>

<p>My favourite day! There is so much rabbit art out there. And so much from Japan and Korean with such cute simple styles. Overall I worry that the styles I chose were a little too simple as Pinterest was pretty full of this kind of thing.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/wap-7.4.2-f3dbc6a4b189038b6ce7c367e69087dd.jpg" width="2400" height="1600" class="img_wQsy"></p>
<p>I found one batch that has a more Disney-type look to it. More details, more kind of human expressions on them. But with some really fun proportion play with feet and ears.</p>

<p>These little guys are very good and I was intrigued by the broken line art style. Where you leave gaps in the lineart to convey the fuzzy or fluffiness. I never try this myself as I worry I don’t have the knowledge to know when to break it up and when not too but after staring at these I don’t think there’s a solid rule to it. So maybe something I can incorporate into other creature drawings.</p>

<p>These guys were probably my favourites for their mix of simplicity and identifying characteristics. 12 different types of buns, most of them being visually unique. A big thing for rabbits seems to be mixing up the line work to show different fur types, from the very shaggy to the shorter haired guys.</p>

<p>The simplest style of all. Very minimal detail, but still very much rabbits based on their small limbs.</p>

<p>I put a non drawing day between day 4 and 5 this week. I’m still not sure if this is better for absorbing lessons or not. I did feel a little creatively stuck when I started, thinking directly of the images I had sketched just days before. While rabbits are nice to look at and all, I felt like I had limited pose material to choose from. I think what I really need to start pushing myself to do is to change my perspective on creatures, move the camera up and down, and have more angles. Just to keep things interesting and see if I understand the shapes from all sides.</p>

<p>While I appreciated returning to a nice easy creature week, I don’t feel as confident about my takeaways due to rabbits being mostly fur. They are another creature that I feel like I should take some time looking at skeletal references to understand what’s going on under all the fluff. Instead of just drawing shapes that imply a rabbit underneath.</p>
<p>I’m making some edits to my subjects for the next few weeks as I’m considering participating in <a href="https://itch.io/jam/nanoreno-2024" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NaNoRenO</a>. A yearly game jam where you try to make a visual novel in the software Ren’py within the month of March. I had already started brainstorming a text based game a few weeks before a friend mentioned the game jam to me. And now it feels like kind of perfect timing. Creatively if not great life timing.</p>
<p>You are allowed to create any art assets before March 1st but I know my landscape skills are rusty from last year's lesson on them, so next week I’ll try to do a week of landscape / coastal vistas while trying to figure out an art style that will work for very quick asset creation in March.</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Week 6 - Goblins]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This week we’re breaking from the format. Kind of in a small way, kind of in a big way. For this week I chose goblins.</p>
<p>Now it’s kind of just like doing another creature, except it has humanoid anatomy and it’s well, not real. There are no real life photographs to learn from for fictional creatures. I wasn’t sure exactly how I was going to deal with this lack when I started the week but I feel like I found a decent formula.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_FNw8" id="day-1---drawing-from-imagination">Day 1 - Drawing from imagination<a href="https://kymira.ca/blog/wap-6#day-1---drawing-from-imagination" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Day 1 - Drawing from imagination" title="Direct link to Day 1 - Drawing from imagination">​</a></h2>
<p>Day 1 was just like other day ones. I had just recently put together my Pinterest board of goblins so they were decently fresh in my head when I sat down to do this.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/wap-6.1-eb39514b669a929f0d174d6c7af8fcce.jpg" width="2310" height="1293" class="img_wQsy"></p>
<p>Still have that usual day 1 messiness but there was one standout face for me.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/wap-6.1.2-75b12f487f6881af7a9a75f2886f3333.jpg" width="800" height="659" class="img_wQsy"></p>
<p>This guy surprises me, one of those “did I draw that??” moments. It’s not like it’s overly complicated but I would usually need to be looking at a reference to get down that face shape!</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_FNw8" id="day-2---figure-sketching">Day 2 - Figure sketching<a href="https://kymira.ca/blog/wap-6#day-2---figure-sketching" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Day 2 - Figure sketching" title="Direct link to Day 2 - Figure sketching">​</a></h2>
<p>For this day 2 I didn’t use photographs but instead tried to pull from my whole Pinterest board. I jumped around from image to image, whichever caught my attention. With a goal of trying out very different goblin styles.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Goblin sketches using references." src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/wap-6.2-b19d0501db4d5bfd8805026819cb02fa.jpg" width="2104" height="3264" class="img_wQsy"></p>
<p>I had hoped to be able to put together a bit of a visual history of goblins and identify current goblin media designs, but Pinterest wasn’t super great at providing that selection. The big ones that came to mind were Magic the Gathering goblins and D&amp;D goblins. Then throw in some cartoon goblins like the ones from Adventure Time. This is probably a do-able project but it would have taken many more days than the hour or so I gave myself to collect references and read the Wikipedia page on goblin origins.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_FNw8" id="day-3---reference-studies">Day 3 - Reference studies<a href="https://kymira.ca/blog/wap-6#day-3---reference-studies" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Day 3 - Reference studies" title="Direct link to Day 3 - Reference studies">​</a></h2>
<p>For day 3 I took my favourite little guys from day 2 and spent more time on them. Tried to look critically at face shape, general body proportions, and ears. These are the standout goblin qualities to me.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/wap-6.3-0aed7a010714ab3eb8426afad476472e.jpg" width="2400" height="1600" class="img_wQsy"></p>
<p>These three felt like they covered different vibes well. I flubbed the very cartoon guys as I tried to push myself on that one instead of re-creating since they had such simple shapes. Maybe not so simple after all…</p>
<p>The ones in red are what I did after the main three. Trying to merge things together and try to identify what kind of vibe I wanted to bring to my own goblin style.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_FNw8" id="day-4---style-studies">Day 4 - Style studies<a href="https://kymira.ca/blog/wap-6#day-4---style-studies" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Day 4 - Style studies" title="Direct link to Day 4 - Style studies">​</a></h2>
<p>Now day 4 is usually style study, but I had basically done that on day 3. I didn’t want to come out of this week having just ripped off someone else’s goblin design so for day 4 I wanted to try out creature design.</p>
<p>I chose my main contenters from day 3 (leaving out simple blob goblin as the first 2 felt like they would make more fitting D&amp;D art). I then found some reference poses, sketched out that wireframe, tripled the frame and drew the same pose 3 times. Times 2 as I did the exercise twice.</p>
<p>The first one was my fave little grumpy guy. I’m very in love with his huge lower jaw. The second guy has great years and a very simple face that looked good on everything. The 3rd one is me taking my favourite parts of the first two and trying to create something new.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/wap-6.4-1906bd805637be2448d613144c7e8f86.jpg" width="2400" height="1600" class="img_wQsy"></p>
<p>Found a middle ground for the ears, mouth from one, nose from the other. Clothing ended up being a bit of a combo and I still don’t love it but this wasn’t a clothing challenge so I let it slide for the exercise.</p>
<p>Overall I’m happy with my 3rd form guy. While it doesn’t feel like the most unique thing in the world, I knew that once I took this design into day 5 I would likely start to deviate even further from my references.</p>
<p>Reference: Grumpy goblin: This one was impossible to find due to the internet being flooded with Baby Yoda art. After a long Instagram scroll I can confirm it’s by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/camkendell/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">camkendell.</a></p>

<p>I didn’t go into day 5 with only imagination, I let myself keep a tab of “action poses” open for this week. Poses wasn’t my area of study for the week and I didn’t want to waste too much time troubleshooting poses when what I was really focused on was character design.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/wap-6.5-aba213baee7072d3e90da19cdf93c1fe.jpg" width="2400" height="1299" class="img_wQsy"></p>
<p>I’m pretty happy with how the goblin guys turned out! The central design didn’t changes too much but I have started to second guess the big ears. I’m also struggling with how to handle the large mouth from multiple angles so that might be a long term project. Playing around with expression would also be fun.</p>

<p>With our iPad being on life support I returned to my Huion and I think I’m really coming around to sketching with it. I’ve warmed up to the default CSP pencils and now really like how they make sketches look.</p>
<p>While there was the extra struggle this week of having to alter the daily programming, I feel like I landed somewhere near typical character design. I could have played with shape language more, and pushed things harder on clothing and expressions but still trying to keep these daily practices fairly focused to avoid feeling overwhelmed.</p>
<p>This week I even spent time inking and colouring one of my practice guys from day 4 instead of day 5 because I was already pretty happy which what I was producing.</p>

<p>Next week I’ll return to a more traditional subject: rabbits.</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Week 5 - Hair styles]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is another week where I wanted to push the boundaries of the format. A large part of drawing practice is to get more ideas into your head, basically to build a shape library. So my goal with this week’s focus was twofold: broaden my mental library of hair styles and also find ways to convey hairstyles as minimally as possible.</p>
<p>After 5 days of it, I’m not sure how I feel.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_FNw8" id="day-1---drawing-from-imagination">Day 1 - Drawing from imagination<a href="https://kymira.ca/blog/wap-5#day-1---drawing-from-imagination" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Day 1 - Drawing from imagination" title="Direct link to Day 1 - Drawing from imagination">​</a></h2>
<p>Day 1 as usual was pretty messy. Put down some vague head shapes and attempted to think of hair styles I know. This day is always a little difficult because you come up against the blank page of your mind. The classic moment of “have I even seen hair before?” when you try to mentally form an image in your head.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/wap-5.1-940858b51635b0ae1de2cfcc30bac292.jpg" width="2857" height="1512" class="img_wQsy"></p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_FNw8" id="day-2---figure-sketching">Day 2 - Figure sketching<a href="https://kymira.ca/blog/wap-5#day-2---figure-sketching" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Day 2 - Figure sketching" title="Direct link to Day 2 - Figure sketching">​</a></h2>
<p>Day 2 went a little better, the gift of being able to look at references. But this leads to falling into the hair trap: Drawing too many lines.</p>
<p>I’ve done hair tutorials before, I know that for drawing detailed hair you want to break it down into sections and try to just draw those sections, add minimal individual strands at the end to add a few fly aways or play with the shape. I find this very hard to do when working from a photo reference as hair is so messy. And the more time I spend on them the more lines I keep adding.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Quick hand sketches using references" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/wap-5.2-1088cc8b89dccf4beaebfd8a99441f6f.jpg" width="2885" height="1496" class="img_wQsy"></p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_FNw8" id="day-3---reference-studies">Day 3 - Reference studies<a href="https://kymira.ca/blog/wap-5#day-3---reference-studies" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Day 3 - Reference studies" title="Direct link to Day 3 - Reference studies">​</a></h2>
<p>This day is supposed to be spending more time with the photo references but that just means adding more strands and making more of a mess :’) I’m not sure why this week feels like it’s going so bad but I’m starting to feel like hair styles may have been too big of a topic. I possibly could have tried a sub theme, like up-dos or long or lose hair. By just trying to do a large variety of hair styles I didn’t feel like I could focus on learning a few tricks to pull off something specific.</p>

<p>When choosing styles to study I very much focused on simplified cartoon styles. Stayed away from over the top anime styles and didn’t want anything super realistic. But I worry this has led to almost too much simplification and I’d like to find a style somewhere in the middle.</p>
<p>I tried using only forward facing faces for this day to make myself think of the hair style from a slightly different but consistent angle.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/wap-5.4.1-79ad5e2141023af9b68753531d01a351.jpg" width="2732" height="2048" class="img_wQsy"></p>

<p>I think this is the middle ground cartoon style I like most. But when looking at these a lot of the bangs and overall styles were a little too un-realistic to me. The artist does say they were exploring futuristic hairstyles so I don't think they are supposed to be the most realistic styles out there.</p>

<p>This is probably the most simplified style out of all of them. Mostly just the exterior lines to show the shape of the hair.</p>
<p>Reference: This is my first full failure to find a reference source. This image has been pinned on Pinterest so many times I can't find a non-Pinterest source. One source was a video so it might be from a TikTok????</p>

<p>While I often feel a little bit of fear on day 5, this is the time I probably feared it the most. Partially because I didn’t feel like I had any big insightful moments during my reference or style study days. And additionally because I didn’t come up with a way to make the “final project” more engaging than drawing shapes on mannequin heads. So I did a few sheets.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/wap-5.5.1-1400d6637c53e2b810209cb76fc7c3ea.jpg" width="2710" height="3097" class="img_wQsy"></p>
<p>These left me feeling rather underwhelmed so I stopped for the day and let myself ruminate on it for a little longer. The next day I sat down and tried to do something a little more directed, which led to you getting to play a Guess That Hair game.</p>

<p>I did look at references for this as the challenge wasn’t just to draw hair but to get it close enough to be able to guess the character just by the hair style. While I don’t feel like this is an overly impressive piece by any means, I am happy that they are all clear to me at a glance. So while I don’t feel confident in my mental library of hair styles I do feel like I’ve found some confidence in translating hair styles into a simplified art style.</p>

<p>I think my lesson for this week is that not all subjects can be covered in a week. While I kind of came to the same conclusion with hands I at least felt like I made progress there while with hair I feel like I just scratched the surface. My biggest takeaway is that I really enjoyed drawing coily hair, it has such a great shape and variety to it.</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A few pieces completed in January]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The weekly art practice posts are taking up a large portion of my creative time but I’m still working on other pieces alongside them. A classic instance of the more time you spend doing a hobby the more you want to do it. The near daily art practice is helping me feel “warmed up” most days, I don’t feel like I need to ease into art every time I want to start something new now. Still rather shocked at how much I’m making.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_FNw8" id="courses">Courses<a href="https://kymira.ca/blog/january-extras#courses" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Courses" title="Direct link to Courses">​</a></h2>
<p>Courses aren’t my big focus for this year but I’ve done 2 small little focused things so far.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_FNw8" id="domestika-course-illustrating-fantastical-animals-with-procreate">Domestika course: Illustrating Fantastical Animals with Procreate<a href="https://kymira.ca/blog/january-extras#domestika-course-illustrating-fantastical-animals-with-procreate" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Domestika course: Illustrating Fantastical Animals with Procreate" title="Direct link to Domestika course: Illustrating Fantastical Animals with Procreate">​</a></h3>
<p><a href="https://www.domestika.org/en/courses/3163-illustrating-fantastical-animals-with-procreate" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Julia Körner</a> is an artist I found on Instagram and saw she had a Domestika course. This was one of the main things that tempted me into a Domestika subscription. I was curious to see what went into her pieces that made them so soft and light.</p>
<p>The course ended up being a pretty typical “follow-along” of the kinds I had done a bunch of on 21Draw. The key takeaways being what kind of brushes an artist uses to get their effects and how do they texture or use light. I attempted to follow her flow when working on this piece of a kobold submarine captain from my current D&amp;D campaign.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="An orange kobold holding a large wrench" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/esior-cacf2261e64e2e87983b935ded2c553c.jpg" width="1895" height="2021" class="img_wQsy"></p>
<p>I’m decently happy with how this one came together, used a few shading techniques that I don’t often do and I like how soft everything looks in the end. Though I can’t say I feel like I have any confidence in being able to draw any more like Körner does by the end of the course. Her unique approach to animals is still very goals.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_FNw8" id="live-drawclass">Live Drawclass<a href="https://kymira.ca/blog/january-extras#live-drawclass" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Live Drawclass" title="Direct link to Live Drawclass">​</a></h3>
<p>I’ve shared a link to a Drawfee Drawclass before, this time I upgraded my Patreon tier and followed one live. The videos are usually posted a month or so after they happen so this one on Character Design should be on YouTube soon.</p>
<p>I was a little disappointed that there wasn’t a clear process or steps explained as I’m a very steps oriented person. Just throwing stuff down or working through multiple ideas isn’t something that helps me focus. But it was still helpful to listen for the two hours and try to apply what was being talked about to my own sketches during the class time.</p>
<p>I tried out Jacob’s first character in a different pose and then simply copied the face he drew. He started with the idea of “tired eyes” which is something I hadn’t tried before so I just wanted to see if I could pull off the same look.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/drawclass1-08e2ed3064e853a98e1ef2fef7d9901f.jpg" width="4080" height="2405" class="img_wQsy"></p>
<p>In the second part I tried to approach the prompt on my own. A plucky sidekick for the first character.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/drawclass2-d1247745384023dc7bb82eff52443e7e.jpg" width="1941" height="1468" class="img_wQsy"></p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_FNw8" id="more-dd-art">More D&amp;D art<a href="https://kymira.ca/blog/january-extras#more-dd-art" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to More D&amp;D art" title="Direct link to More D&amp;D art">​</a></h2>
<p>This is a digital re-draw of a piece I did probably 3-4 years ago now. I decided to use them as a character in my current underwater D&amp;D campaign. I had them planned for a year before even starting the campaign, and I knew I wanted a new version of the piece to show the players for when the reveal would happen. It took almost a year of running the campaign before I even got to that reveal and I still didn’t finish this piece 2 months before I shared it in game.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="A drider hiding behind a large colourful crystal." src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/yirrekeb-ecc3c68562ab9c5e6d99fc560e3f9e08.jpg" width="2020" height="2048" class="img_wQsy"></p>

<p>These were a headache. I had tried learning vector art many months ago now and failed to produce anything I was happy with. In my first attempt I was trying to re-create icons I had drawn in a regular art program. These ended up being too detailed and had too many colours to keep the svg format happy. I got frustrated and gave up on them.</p>
<p>This time around I was going to go in fresh. Which meant finding/learning a new program that would do svgs and choosing new ideas. I ended up using Linearity Curve for the iPad and it wasn’t terrible. It even had a “covert to vector”-like feature that you could do to any image. I did this for one royalty free squirrel photo I found, which became icon number one. Then I traced over messy sketches for squirrel 2 and the crow.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/3icons-41cb415b208ca8285baa9026f7fef2f8.jpg" width="1600" height="551" class="img_wQsy"></p>
<p>I probably should have done 3 squirrels or something to better convey what each section is but I wasn’t loving the process. Maybe someday I’ll revisit vectors but they just really aren’t my speed.</p>]]></content>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Week 4 - Hands]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Honestly surprised that this is 4 for 4 this month. Maybe I can do a blog post every week. Though I suspect committing to extremely minimal social time for January and my workplace being a disaster has contributed to having enough time to pull it off.</p>
<p>Anyway, I hope you like looking at hands. I don’t find them as exciting as pigeons or squirrels but after a few weeks of easy-ish creatures I wanted to try something that would be a serious push. And which would be applicable to more art pieces. I have an animation I’ve been working on that’s taken twice as long because of how much time I’ve spent fighting with the hands. Ended up going with a very blob like shape in the end just to keep making progress. Time to see if a week of hands can carry me through drawing more hands in the future.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_FNw8" id="day-1---drawing-from-imagination">Day 1 - Drawing from imagination<a href="https://kymira.ca/blog/wap-4#day-1---drawing-from-imagination" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Day 1 - Drawing from imagination" title="Direct link to Day 1 - Drawing from imagination">​</a></h2>
<p>The first thing I noticed about this week is that it’s difficult to draw hands <em>without</em> a reference. They are right there, doing the work, you can’t look away. I tried my best to not do any posing or staring at my hands for too long in hopes of forcing my brain to think of the shapes itself.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Rough hand sketches in a notebook." src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/wap-4.1-2e4ca6b930d7a0a85541725f75657781.jpg" width="2953" height="1745" class="img_wQsy"></p>

<p>Day two I gave myself more freedom to look at local hands while also using some references.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Quick hand sketches using references" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/wap-4.2-377f467d1cb69ad5ec263f7a6ed17cf1.jpg" width="2178" height="1264" class="img_wQsy"></p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_FNw8" id="day-3---reference-drawing">Day 3 - Reference Drawing<a href="https://kymira.ca/blog/wap-4#day-3---reference-drawing" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Day 3 - Reference Drawing" title="Direct link to Day 3 - Reference Drawing">​</a></h2>
<p>Now with more serious references in play, I’ve come to the conclusion that we shouldn’t render hands too much. When you start looking at the specific details and shapes fingers make in photos, they sometimes translate terribly when putting them to paper. There’s also just so many wrinkles and curves that it’s easy for a hand to become muddy very quickly.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/wap-4.3.1-e4fef44f3e8277db3e6c31ea6b246f57.jpg" width="2732" height="2048" class="img_wQsy"></p>
<p>There were 9 hands here but I just went with one or else this could have been the only reference image I needed. Thumb up seemed like a nice starting point. Keep most of the fingers partially hidden.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/wap-4.3.2-d3388791cf892d063bec66a9b1f760a9.jpg" width="2732" height="2048" class="img_wQsy"></p>
<p>Fingers coming towards the camera has always been a weakness of mine. I find it very difficult to convey the depth in a hand so that each finger is still readable.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/wap-4.3.3-71c0ee932ee13848e674d2a9660e36fa.jpg" width="2732" height="2048" class="img_wQsy"></p>
<p>Another coming towards the camera one, proof I was trying to challenge myself. This hand is one of the ones that helped me see how strangely angular hands can be.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/wap-4.3.4-94275265888f871c7760b994876e1c9a.jpg" width="2732" height="2048" class="img_wQsy"></p>
<p>And then holding a ball. Often if I’m doing a character drawing the character is often holding or touching something so object interaction is a pretty important shape to practise for me.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_FNw8" id="day-4---style-study">Day 4 - Style study<a href="https://kymira.ca/blog/wap-4#day-4---style-study" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Day 4 - Style study" title="Direct link to Day 4 - Style study">​</a></h2>
<p>After my conclusion of “too much detail = bad” I was excited to get some ideas for simple approaches. I’m often drawing hands on small characters where the hand isn’t the focus but is often trying to communicate something. I just need enough details for it to be clear what kind of action the hand is doing.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/wap-4.4.1-03362d697241d89b0d3ad3980973bd9a.jpg" width="2732" height="2048" class="img_wQsy"></p>
<p>Started with fingers. Seems to make sense to start with the small part of a bigger object. I’m pretty familiar with the tube or sausages approach to drawing fingers but this was the first time I saw it done with a variety of perspectives.</p>

<p>I enjoy the box breakdown of hands, really helps to keep the 3D shape of the hand. But as I worked on these I did start to feel like they were too realistic to really be a style study.</p>

<p>Now here are some hands that really embrace the angular-ness of fingers! Each finger looks so strong and expressive. But look at them the wrong way and I get confused at what I’m looking at.</p>

<p>I fell in love with this style. So sleek and simple but so expressive. The lines are easy to draw after a few tries and it just felt good. I didn’t commit to carrying this style through all my other practices but it’s definitely something filed away in my mind now.</p>

<p>I caught this one last minute on Pinterest right before I started my drawing session. It was a style different from the other 2 previous ones, more cartoony, which was very much something I wanted to try. Just get even simpler but also rounder and cuter. It makes the hands stand out less but possibly easier to execute.</p>
<p>I was enjoying these so I took some photos and tried to adapt those poses with the style.</p>

<p>Test day. After my coloured pigeon piece from last week I decided that I wanted to do something like that as a final project of sorts for each theme. So I started day 5’s drawing time with some sketches, mostly trying to capture the styles that I had practiced the day before.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/wap-4.5.1-e67a18cff67a77437c469aa2d7ba144d.jpg" width="2732" height="2048" class="img_wQsy"></p>
<p>Then I wanted to do something a little more detailed. Something that could be part of a larger piece where maybe the focus of the illustration is on the hands.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/wap-4.5.2-30018dd9d4554e12712f9b34787288cc.jpg" width="2219" height="1709" class="img_wQsy"></p>
<p>My girlfriend says this looks like a tattoo design and after she said it I could see it. Add a bit more ling definition to the flame and it could be a weird clavicle piece.</p>

<p>It will get tedious to keep saying “I’m shocked at how much 4 days of practice does!” it does still feel like that every day 5. I honestly enjoy drawing hands but do find it difficult. I think a big part of learning from this week was once again to embrace very simplified styles. And maybe adopt a drawing approach of continuous practice…</p>
<p>I’m happy that this week wasn’t as hard as I feared. It didn’t feel overly difficult compared to the creatures from before. And having pages full of floating hands looks pretty cool.</p>
<p>Later today I’m attending an online art lesson on the character design process by one of the Drawfee hosts, so I might have a project to blog about from that. I also have a few other fully coloured pieces from the last few months that I haven’t included anywhere. And my attempts at vector art to be the new icons for this site. So I may have multiple posts over the next few weeks. While also trying to prepare and participate in Funguary again.</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Week 3 - Pigeons]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Another week of having a good amount of time to devote to art. Huion tablet setup is reliable once more and now I don’t need to fight with making sure the pressure settings are working every time I turn it on.</p>
<p>Pigeons are the 3rd most common creature on our back patio so this is a creature a see regularly, unlike the pangolin. Love to see him, love when they awkwardly try to cling to the trellis.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_FNw8" id="day-1---drawing-from-imagination">Day 1 - Drawing from imagination<a href="https://kymira.ca/blog/wap-3#day-1---drawing-from-imagination" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Day 1 - Drawing from imagination" title="Direct link to Day 1 - Drawing from imagination">​</a></h2>
<p>Day one wasn’t too intimidating. The hardest part is trying to not fall into the habits of drawing other birds. I drew a lot of birds of prey as a kid but pigeons have very little in common with raptors. So I find myself struggling with their longer necks and small beaks.</p>
<p>My pigeons ended up looking more like chickens.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="First pigeon sketches." src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/wap-3.1-536b78336615466473615317e403dfbf.jpg" width="2972" height="1776" class="img_wQsy"></p>

<p>As usual I think I’m maybe spending too much time on these. I need to get better at setting a timer to limit myself to 2-3 minutes per reference or else I fall into doing more fully reference sketches.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Quick pigeon sketches using references" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/wap-3.2-63fc214c5c52904a5ff15f8aae98b456.jpg" width="3065" height="1784" class="img_wQsy"></p>

<p>It’s hard to resist just drawing pigeons in ball form. Love when they bury their head in their big neck and poof up. But I managed to resist and try a few other poses. I also tried to play around a bit with colour here but didn’t want that to be a big focus.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/wap-3.3.1-9fcdfe2214aa37d77b6249ff0eefcd89.jpg" width="2400" height="1600" class="img_wQsy"></p>
<p>Simple start, standing in profile. Probably could have spent more time on this one but I tend to start fast and then slowly put more time into each reference practice piece.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/wap-3.3.2-cc8ab76e7f6b9033766ad5bbf82d04ae.jpg" width="2400" height="1600" class="img_wQsy"></p>
<p>The prettiest pigeon! While I have focused on rock doves for my reference I chose this one for it’s more unique pose and colours.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/wap-3.3.3-737250ecd50b1cde78f8925ffea69664.jpg" width="2400" height="1600" class="img_wQsy"></p>
<p>Fluff! Fluff! As much as I love them I struggle to make them round enough. Need to “push the pose” when the pose is “be a circle”.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/wap-3.3.4-7a68ab9d10651fd8f86391c18690e50b.jpg" width="2400" height="1600" class="img_wQsy"></p>
<p>Wings are still a challenge when you don’t want to draw 100 feathers but also don’t want to do an empty block shape.</p>

<p>There are a lot of good stylized pigeons out there. I try to choose a variety of them to see some different approaches. Thankfully pigeons aren’t super complicated body-wise, but I feel like it’s still hard to capture their cute-ness.

<p>Some nice simple guys here. They make the pigeon feel a little more fluid.</p>

<p>Such confident shapes! I feel like this one really helped nail down the simplified shapes going on.</p>

<p>I love when pigeons are balls. This one just felt very expressive with a very simple shape. I made the beak too large on mine but I still find it very cute. I don’t have the instinct to add the little shiver lines like on the top of this guy but it adds so much on the original.</p>

<p>These guys have great personalities and good weird shapes. They’re a little outside my comfort style zone so definitely felt like a stretch.</p>

<p>I of course went for a round guy for my final test day. But I felt like this first one was a little too sketch-y to be my final piece for the week.</p>

<p>I decided to go for a more stylized one with proper line art and some sort of colour approach.</p>

<p>I found it weirdly difficult to make up my mind about soft colours and hard colours here. Ended up with the soft blend on the neck feathers and then the harder greys on the wings. I don’t love the combo but I didn’t like when the neck colours were hard edged. But otherwise, kind of pleased with this guy.</p>

<p>Now that I’ve done 3 weeks of animals I’m going to try working on some smaller focus things for a few weeks.</p>
<p>Time for a real artist challenge: Hands. Not sure how this one will go. But hoping to gain some hand confidence.</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Week 2 is pangolins]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A wild week at work resulted in me spending most of my evenings trying not to think about it by drawing. So here are a bunch of sketches of pangolins.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_FNw8" id="day-1---drawing-from-imagination">Day 1 - Drawing from imagination<a href="https://kymira.ca/blog/wap-2#day-1---drawing-from-imagination" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Day 1 - Drawing from imagination" title="Direct link to Day 1 - Drawing from imagination">​</a></h2>
<p>Since day 1 is drawing from imagination I didn’t want to look at a single reference image before starting. This resulted in a funny mistake.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Messy pangolin sketches." src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/wap-2.1-f3bf864a06f40808808a4ed1efefadaa.jpg" width="3063" height="1886" class="img_wQsy"></p>
<p>I had a moment early on, of asking myself, do pangolins have ears that poke out? I didn’t want to break the assignment by looking at a reference so I gave them little poky ears… which was wrong.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_FNw8" id="day-2---figure-sketching">Day 2 - Figure sketching<a href="https://kymira.ca/blog/wap-2#day-2---figure-sketching" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Day 2 - Figure sketching" title="Direct link to Day 2 - Figure sketching">​</a></h2>
<p>I was able to correct my mental image of pangolins on day 2. These quick sketches reinforced my thinking that these guys have a similar build to squirrels in a few ways. They have the same triangle-ish arms, smaller chest zone big butt zone, long tails. But even with those similarities I feel like they give off very different vibes.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Quick pangolin sketches using references" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/wap-2.2-b682b36835920cbab8f5398b186a3a55.jpg" width="3072" height="1969" class="img_wQsy"></p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_FNw8" id="day-3---reference-studies">Day 3 - Reference studies<a href="https://kymira.ca/blog/wap-2#day-3---reference-studies" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Day 3 - Reference studies" title="Direct link to Day 3 - Reference studies">​</a></h2>
<p>I really like day 3. Having an image up and scrutinising it for the mistakes I made in the first 2 days feels like the learning coming together. However this is also when I get torn about being more detail oriented (draw all the armour scales) and skipping over that because it’s not the most educational in these exercises but is fun.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Pangolin walking" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/wap-2.3.1-f366f8ff573318a92f2e37b1a587278e.jpg" width="2498" height="900" class="img_wQsy"></p>

<p>Having seen a few stylizing pangolins in the wild previously I knew I could get some good variety here. I tried to choose some of the more stylized versions to learn from. Especially when it comes to different approaches to doing the scales.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Vector art simplified pangolins." src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/wap-2.4.1-ad65375ffcb05e90cf6e5886772d7079.jpg" width="1893" height="1350" class="img_wQsy"></p>
<p>These guys got simplified down to zig zag patterns which is pretty good. Though I don’t love how it makes them look so smooth.</p>

<p>These guys have just the hint of triangles to convey where the scales would be. I feel like this is a nice compromise when working with simple shapes or a limited colour palette or size.</p>

<p>These ones were pretty normal and I didn’t want to spend all my time drawing on the scales so I moved on.</p>

<p>Then this guy is mostly just has shapes thrown down to hint at the repetition and presence of the scales.</p>

<p>This second time around felt less test-like than week one. This time the struggle was pangolin poses. While I felt like I had spent the week getting their shape down I didn’t really spend enough time watching them move about. Squirrels I see every day, I get them. Pangolins are pretty mysteries. So I felt a little limited by my ability to imagine them in a variety of poses.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Four digital pangolin sketches." src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/wap-2.5-811c628c109444138071e295c40497b8.jpg" width="1959" height="1242" class="img_wQsy"></p>
<p>I do at least like them, I think these pieces are still cute and do look like pangolins. But the movement and idea of looking at videos alongside still images is a good takeaway for creatures moving forward.</p>

<p>Week 2 felt like it went pretty smoothly. And that’s with the hiccup of sending our iPad in for repairs. So this week's digital sketches were done on my Huion tablet that I set up for the first time in 3 years. This meant a little bit of adjustment time and tech troubleshooting before I could get to my daily practice. Slowed me down a bit but should now be prepared to survive without the iPad for a week.</p>
<p>Now to prep for week 3: Pigeons</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[First week of my new art practice schedule]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The way I titled this post implies that I’ll post one of these every week… I don’t think that’s feasible. I have most of the first week of January off so this week is already easier than every week which will follow this year. I think it’s more likely that I’ll try to summarise one or two weeks a month, or I’ll summarise a whole month of practice all at once. It will be difficult to find 15-30 minutes for art every day along with writing and blog management time.</p>
<p>But since I have the time now, I’ll detail how this first week of the Jacob Drawfee Schedule went for me.</p>
<p>Theme for week 1: Squirrels.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_FNw8" id="day-1---drawing-from-imagination">Day 1 - Drawing from imagination<a href="https://kymira.ca/blog/wap-1#day-1---drawing-from-imagination" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Day 1 - Drawing from imagination" title="Direct link to Day 1 - Drawing from imagination">​</a></h2>
<p>Squirrels have been one of my obsessions since moving into my most recent apartment. We have a large back patio with an active squirrel highway (telephone line) that provides a lot of entertainment. I have collected a lot of photographs of squirrels hanging out and in the summer we put out water to help them stay hydrated so they come by more often.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Photograph of a squirrel visiting our water dish." src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/patio-squirrel-db5dc6ae2a8df5998abac94cfffc178a.jpg" width="3072" height="4080" class="img_wQsy"></p>
<p>I’ve been trying to draw squirrels for the last year but even with their small form I feel like there is always something lacking from my sketches. They felt like the perfect first theme, giving me a chance to finally troubleshoot what about the squirrel makes them difficult for me to draw. On Sunday I filled a page in my sketchbook with different squirrel attempts while sketching for 15 minutes.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Photo of my sketch book filled with sketchy squirrels." src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/wap-1.1-3ddc42b4a2347120d0081a49f0a411af.jpg" width="3072" height="2080" class="img_wQsy"></p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_FNw8" id="day-2---speed-sketching">Day 2 - Speed sketching<a href="https://kymira.ca/blog/wap-1#day-2---speed-sketching" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Day 2 - Speed sketching" title="Direct link to Day 2 - Speed sketching">​</a></h2>
<p>I prepared for day 2 in advance by preparing a <a href="https://www.pinterest.ca/maeanu3639/squirrel-refs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pinterest board</a> of squirrel photographs as day 2 is basically quick figure drawing. Using references but mostly to grasp shapes and movement of the subject. It did take some time to collect images so I suspect this will be something I’m trying to rush through before every new week starts.</p>
<p>I set my timer to 15 minutes again. I probably spent too much time on the first page squirrels, somewhere in the 2-4 minute zone on each. This didn’t feel like enough so I did a 2nd page where I forced myself to move through them a little faster.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Photo of a sketchbook page." src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/wap-1.2.1-7944e073baf3322b4a2b4ff2c997de75.jpg" width="3016" height="1831" class="img_wQsy"></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Photo of a sketchbook page covered in small squirrels" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/wap-1.2.2-3609cffdfacb09ebc1598cf62b0afad0.png" width="1964" height="1460" class="img_wQsy"></p>
<p>These felt pretty messy but it was interesting to see these squirrels next to my day 1 non-reference squirrels and see how much of a difference that makes already.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_FNw8" id="day-3---reference-drawing">Day 3 - Reference Drawing<a href="https://kymira.ca/blog/wap-1#day-3---reference-drawing" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Day 3 - Reference Drawing" title="Direct link to Day 3 - Reference Drawing">​</a></h2>
<p>I switched to the iPad for day 3 because I knew I’d want the ability to draw over reference images. I find this extremely helpful when trying to really get the anatomy and proper shape down from a reference. I chose 4 photos to start with and didn’t give myself a time limit. The goal for the day was 15 minutes but I think I spent closer to 20 minutes on each one.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Squirrel study 1" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/wap-1.3.1-3bbba748b9020570869c8b67d0b6c79b.jpg" width="2514" height="1878" class="img_wQsy"></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Squirrel study 2" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/wap-1.3.2-1746a557680ff1411d8232c38a576482.jpg" width="2441" height="1900" class="img_wQsy"></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Squirrel study 3" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/wap-1.3.3-024ba19b8fee224767ae601a0c4a586a.jpg" width="2422" height="1693" class="img_wQsy"></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Squirrel study 4" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/wap-1.3.4-205932e8ff470c29e755b04a7fafe515.jpg" width="2343" height="1805" class="img_wQsy"></p>
<p>I was honestly very happy with the first study. I felt like I got the shapes right and captured a good squirrel face. 3 and 4 were tougher. In 3 I struggled to get the head right and 4 was so different from the other that I could barely get the proportion right. Hence breaking the image into sections and trying to figure it out from there. Overall I think I spent 2 hours from gathering the images to finalising the last one.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_FNw8" id="day-4---style-study">Day 4 - Style study<a href="https://kymira.ca/blog/wap-1#day-4---style-study" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Day 4 - Style study" title="Direct link to Day 4 - Style study">​</a></h2>
<p>I was really excited for day 4 which is for study from other artists. This is to help identify how other artists simplify the harder parts of the subject and which parts they focus on. I know that this is one of my main weaknesses, I often feel trapped between trying to stick to the details of realism or going so simple I love the main features of a creature. Conveniently I already had a <a href="https://www.pinterest.ca/maeanu3639/squirrel-inspo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pinterest board of squirrel art from last year</a>. Downside, there isn’t as much cartoon squirrel art as I would like.</p>
<p>I chose a few and started to approach them in the same way I did the reference photos. Try to figure out the central shapes, especially the ones that persisted between different artists. The small very simplified squirrels probably ended up being the most helpful as they often came in large groups.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Page one of style practice" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/wap-1.4.1-9a86eb2b843ae808b7f6d95c8b0a6cb2.jpg" width="2714" height="1524" class="img_wQsy"></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Page two of style practice" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/wap-1.4.2-665d270589ce90f51b1a8e215b7f6400.jpg" width="2177" height="1458" class="img_wQsy"></p>
<p>After sketching the reference images, I went and grabbed some more photos and then tried to draw the new photo while using the styles I was copying. This felt like a good stretch to try to apply the style I had been working from to something new instead of just trying to mimic the same image.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_FNw8" id="day-5---drawing-from-imagination-take-2">Day 5 - Drawing from imagination, take 2<a href="https://kymira.ca/blog/wap-1#day-5---drawing-from-imagination-take-2" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Day 5 - Drawing from imagination, take 2" title="Direct link to Day 5 - Drawing from imagination, take 2">​</a></h2>
<p>Day 5 was scary for me, felt like a test day. This day is meant to be an application of what you’d learned from the past 3 days of drawing from references. I was scared that it would feel like day 1 and that I would be uncomfortable putting pencil to paper without a reference to look at.</p>
<p>In hopes of not getting afraid of the blank page I wrote down a few actions that a squirrel could be doing, jump, sleep, climb, run, sit. I looked back and my past few days of pages and then started drawing.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Day 5 sketches" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/wap-1.5-0f9e060a32148e356515e5ff08b7cf14.jpg" width="3072" height="1971" class="img_wQsy"></p>
<p>I was honestly rather surprised with the results. I felt like I finally had a good grasp of squirrel faces and proportions, even managed to try out multiple poses without references. Sure none of them were super dynamic but we’re trying one thing pre week. I’m mostly shocked at how much difference 3 days made:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="side by side of day 1 and day 5" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/wap-1-comparison-5261edb5164984e94c95020ddb0f2e67.jpg" width="3072" height="1111" class="img_wQsy"></p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_FNw8" id="conclusion">Conclusion<a href="https://kymira.ca/blog/wap-1#conclusion" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Conclusion" title="Direct link to Conclusion">​</a></h2>
<p>I feel like this first week is proof that this is a viable practice approach! I am still afraid of being able to commit to it every week for a year. And lowering how much time I can spend on each day will probably make progress slower (I’m aiming for 15-30 minutes every day instead of the 1-2 hours I did this week). But now that I’m familiar with what’s needed each day I feel like that direction will be enough to carry me through most days.</p>
<p>Now to prepare for week 2: Pangolins.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have re-written this blog post 3 times.</p>
<p>I thought it would be easy, thought I could laugh in the face of game journalism. But instead I’ve spent the last 2 weeks being rather critical of game journalism and thinking about how it can even be possible to review games if you don’t finish them or physically have the time to play them to the end.</p>
<p>I would be a hypocrite to give a review for games I didn’t finish but also not finishing a game is generally a sign that I wasn’t really feeling it, which is a review in and of itself.</p>
<p>So I think the best way to approach this isn’t to say these are my reviews of games, but these are some games I loved and some I didn’t love so much in 2023 and that’s just one person's experience with them.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_FNw8" id="the-good">The good<a href="https://kymira.ca/blog/games-2023#the-good" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The good" title="Direct link to The good">​</a></h2>
<p>This was a banger year for AAA game releases this year. Some long awaited games dropped and they even managed to live up to expectations.</p>
<p>The first AAA game of the year I completed was a hold over. I didn’t get far in <strong>Elden Ring</strong> in 2022 when we bought it, but something in early 2023 brought us back to it and completely hooked us. The early game that didn’t click with me started to make sense, I finally got a grasp on the controls and small bits of the lore felt like the best reward you could find. It also helped that I felt like I started to get really good at it and would spend a lot of my time helping other people kill bosses in their worlds.</p>
<p>My time with <strong>Tears of the Kingdom</strong> was greatly enjoyed, but I still haven’t reached the end. The world is sprawling and there’s a new quest waiting for you under every rock. It was cool to get a voice acted Zelda and the powers you’re gifted at the start of the game were a lot of fun, maybe even revolutionary for games going forward. It genuinely felt like a fresh way to engage with an open world. But I’ll be honest, I didn’t go about the world crafting masterpieces out of tree logs. I’m pretty sure I under-used the crafting feature compared to other people. So while I had many moments of delight and I’m sure what was done here is going to influence game development for the next 5 years, it wasn’t my top game of the year.</p>
<p>Fire <strong>Emblem Engage</strong> had its moments but it didn’t click for me. I didn’t care for the main characters but I did love some of the side characters and there were some honest moments in the writing that got me to laugh out loud. But it became another game where I didn’t make it to the credits.</p>
<p><strong>Diablo 4</strong> – I had never played a Diablo game before but my girlfriend has a fondness for them and the promise of couch co-op is all it takes to get me to be excited about a game. This game has some of the goriest cutscenes I’ve ever seen and the story is very dark. But the game play is a nice level of mindless and constant which makes it a great game for melting the hours away while feeling powerful.</p>
<p><strong>Baldur’s Gate 3</strong> was mind blowing for the first 50 hours or so, and then started to close up for me. I loved act 1 and 2 but then act 3 arrived and things began to feel too directed. Which makes sense, the plot lines do need to start wrapping up. But having started 3 new runs of the game in the first few weeks out of excitement, when I did have the credits roll for the first time, I honestly had no feelings of wanting to continue my other playthrough. Everything kind of fell flat.</p>
<p>There is a new epilogue that adds a lot more dialogue between characters at the end which people are hoping improves the ending but I’m not sure when I’ll have time to drop another 70 hours on playing BG3 again just to experience it.</p>
<p>The last AAA game of the year I played was <strong>Mario Wonder</strong>. I’ve loved most Mario platformers and this one has a few new developments which keep things fresh. This is possibly the easiest platformer that’s come out in a while? There are some very difficult levels that are mostly optional and very fun and stressful. But most of the regular levels never took more than one attempt when playing with two people.</p>
<p>Now onto some indie darlings.</p>
<p>Teenage dinosaurs facing the end of the world. <a href="https://goodbyevolcanohigh.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Goodbye Volcano High</a> is one of the most ambitious musical VNs I’ve ever experienced. <del>I think I have about 1 hour left and I’m dragging my feet on it because I know the end will make me sad.</del> (Finished this hours before midnight on New Years Eve!) It has a lot of interesting stuff going on mechanic wise, small little interactions that keep you physically invested in controlling the character in small ways. The music was the big selling point for me though, I’ve been listening to the <a href="https://dabuaudio.bandcamp.com/album/goodbye-volcano-high-original-game-soundtrack" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the original sound track</a> on repeat for weeks.</p>
<p><a href="https://nuts.game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NUTS!</a> I’m not exclaiming this loudly, the title is all in the cap. But the exclamation point was added by me! This game was a gem to find. A natural surveillance game where you set up cameras in a forest to watch squirrels run around in the night. A game targeted specifically at me! I found this game rather scary (you are alone in the woods and this is a big fear of mine in the real world). It’s really not scary but has some minor suspense floating about. This game is available on so many systems now, please play this game so people make more squirrel games.</p>
<p>Next up, a game about fate, tarot cards, witches living in space: <a href="https://www.cosmicwheelsisterhood.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Cosmic Wheel Sisterhood</a>. I loved the art for this as soon as I saw it, and the game idea instantly hooked me. I finished this and instantly started playing it again. One of the most unique games I’ve played in a long time.</p>
<p>A game I played for the first time this year that’s been on the top of a lot of peoples charts was <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/slay_the_spire" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Slay the Spire</a>. This was a lot of fun and it’s cool to see the game that likely launched the wave of card based combat that is so prevalent right now. I got through the flow only once and I can see there is much more to the game that I would enjoy but there are too many games to keep playing this one over and over.</p>
<p>The game I had hesitated to play after hearing about it for months was <strong>Vampire Survivors</strong>. And the only reason I gave it a shot was because I had a 3 hour flight to fill and it can be played for free in offline mode on a phone. This game absolutely slaps and is a classic version of “more than meets the eye”. Just a little weird game that took off overnight, can be bought for 3$ and is super addictive.</p>
<p>And now for the only AAAA on the list (and likely in existence): <strong>Genshin Impact</strong>. I come and go with Genshin but I’ve played for nearly 3 years straight at this point. While its basic gameplay mechanics aren’t super impressive and I don’t recommend this game to most people due to it being a gatha game, it does keep me coming back. There is something very captivating about watching the evolution of this game, its place in the world, the huge projects Hoyoverse undertakes, and the ridiculous crossovers. I can’t look away from it.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_FNw8" id="the-meh">The meh<a href="https://kymira.ca/blog/games-2023#the-meh" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The meh" title="Direct link to The meh">​</a></h2>
<p><strong>Dredge</strong> was an early release for the year and one I had on my rader from its demo release in 2022.I was pretty hype for this one, it does a lot of things I love: Weird occult magic in a small isolated town with a bunch of scary underwater creatures. Unfortunately the game fell flat in a lot of areas for me, there were things in the demo I was hoping to see more of but some of those parts of the game didn’t feature as much in the full game (ferrying questionable stuff, struggle to stay alive, development of NPC stories). There have been some expansion since I finished it so I am a little curious to see if the new content would change my opinion but I don’t have the urge to return to it just yet.</p>
<p>The first game I finished for the year was <strong>Spirifarer</strong>, a very beloved indie game that I enjoyed the first 10 hours of but then fell into a repetitive slump. I didn’t love the main story arc and rushed the ending just to get things over with.</p>
<p><strong>Hi-Fi Rush</strong> was a surprise drop. I loved the art style and the fact that it was a rhythm combat game. The story was even decently fun with some good over the top characters. But I fell off of it after about 5-10 hours. There ended up being a bunch of powerup management and that’s something that often turns me off games pretty quickly. Basic concept = lots of fun, developed concept = too much for me.</p>

<p>This post has already gotten too long and I haven’t even managed to mention all the GameBoy games I’ve been playing on our new <a href="https://www.analogue.co/pocket" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Analogue Pocket</a>. So I’ll just say GameBoy games are still great, almost shockingly so. My current obsession is playing the French version of Pokemon Fire Red, a game I think I’ve played 3 times in my life already. And I’m now eyeing up games easily over 10 years old for the start of the new year.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_FNw8" id="kylies-state-of-the-game">Kylie’s State of the Game<a href="https://kymira.ca/blog/games-2023#kylies-state-of-the-game" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Kylie’s State of the Game" title="Direct link to Kylie’s State of the Game">​</a></h2>
<p>While most games I played ended up in my “good” category for the year, it’s a little strange to say that there wasn’t a game that surpassed my current top three. (I’m counting Elden Ring as a last year game as that’s when it came out and I finished it before almost all the other games I played this year so it feels like forever ago, I honestly thought it was a year ago).</p>
<p>Elden Ring – Hades – Inscryption</p>
<p>Everything I play is compared to those games right now. If I see even just a screencap of those games I want to go and play them again. NUTS came close but it was a pretty small indie project that we won’t see much more of. Baldur’s Gate 3 is technically impressive with it’s huge branching choice system but stumbled at the end and having experienced many bugs in my playthrough (a major one even ruined a dramatic boss fight and story beat) it just can’t stand up to my current top three.</p>
<p>With all these big games dropping this year I’m not sure what to expect for 2024. I’m sure there will be some more stealth drops that will catch the gaming world off guard, but I don’t have anything that I’m waiting for beyond the Elden Ring expansion. So maybe I’ll have time to catch up on some older backlogs for once.</p>]]></content>

        <updated>2023-12-27T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[How I managed a year of hobbies.]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This end of year post is rather different from the reviews I’ve been writing. It’s more of a personal review of a journaling method I’ve been using this year to help manage multiple hobbies. If you are extremely minimalist while also loving to plan your life month by month, it could work for you too. But at the moment it’s extremely tailored to me of my kind-of hyper organised lifestyle.</p>
<p>This approach came about after multiple chats with my therapist of me complaining about how I have no time for hobbies and when I commit to one it feels like I lose the ability to stay interested in the rest. I often hyper focus on whatever activity currently has me in its grips. The other focus of this method was to help balance executive dysfunction when it comes to those “I would rather die” tasks. Things like phoning the doctor, filing medical papers, or chores that have been put off for months.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_FNw8" id="origin">Origin<a href="https://kymira.ca/blog/microjournaling#origin" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Origin" title="Direct link to Origin">​</a></h2>
<p>Even while being someone who loves to make a to-do list, I haven’t been a journaler since my early teens. Unless we still count LiveJournal, then my early 20s. Once I was done with school the habit died off even more.</p>
<p>The bullet journal fad came and went (still here?) and while I was enamoured with the accessories, washi tape, nice journals, nice pens. It wasn’t enough to get me to commit to keeping a journal.</p>
<p>But then I started therapy and I started to have more things to write down. I loved when my therapist would give me homework or a suggestion on an activity or emotion to chart. I liked being able to look back on progress while reminding myself that therapy was changing aspects of my life.</p>
<p>This never became anything huge but it meant I finally used some pages in my nice notebooks.</p>
<p>And then there was the pandemic. I was already unemployed when the lockdown part of the pandemic hit Montreal, and like many people I fell into a bit of a malaise. My regular hobbies couldn’t hold my attention, the world was falling apart and I spent hours doom scrolling. This became another thing to come up in therapy and the main suggestion I got was “even if you don’t feel like doing X will be relaxing, try doing X for 10 minutes”. The idea behind it was to give a hobby an honest try for a very small time commitment. If it wasn’t working I could move on to something else pretty quickly. But if it felt good then I was likely to stick with it for much longer (This is very familiar to how you approach building a regular practice!).</p>
<p>With that advice I made it through the major lockdown and a major life change, touching my hobbies from time to time but mostly letting them fall to the side. At the end of 2022 I felt like things had settled enough that I could give my hobbies another try. But I was ambitious, I didn’t want to get back into one hobby, I wanted to get back to most of them: drawing, reading, website development, and video games.</p>
<p>(Video games were the most sturdy hobby, that one never really fell off. The problem with it was that it has the most potential to over take my time and push the other hobbies out.)</p>
<p>And so with my previous experiences of to-do lists and methods of approaching hobbies, I made myself a single page journal.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Photo of my journaling process. One page is creative goal for the month while the 2nd page is a list of tasks for each month." src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/micro-journal1-729c0d5f54bd74f59db6de5e4b8894b7.jpg" width="3000" height="2349" class="img_wQsy"></p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_FNw8" id="the-page">The page<a href="https://kymira.ca/blog/microjournaling#the-page" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The page" title="Direct link to The page">​</a></h2>
<p>Single page maybe isn’t accurate. I used a single page to plan my hobbies over the course of the year, and one more page for dealing with responsibilities.</p>
<p>When I look at this I feel like I’ve taken bullet journaling to the next level. An approach that was already pretty minimal and now I reduced it even further.</p>
<p>For each month I would prioritise a little bit of each hobby: 1 book, 1 video game, 1 art course, 1 blog post, 1 website project, etc.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Photo of my journaling process. The first page with my hobby goals on it." src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/micro-journal2-61da2d6acf3587e0ffb53b34d6ed74c2.jpg" width="1827" height="2093" class="img_wQsy"></p>
<p>My idea behind this was that if I finished my game of the month, I would have to check off the other hobbies before returning to another new video game. This helped me to balance my free time between hobbies instead of just going to the easiest choice with my free time.</p>
<p>The one I do feel like I struggled with was reading. This is a hobby that can suck me in or turn me away. If I read a book I enjoy I’ll start another one quickly and then can often get a streak going. But if I read something less exciting it’s hard to get me to pick up a book for a few months. It was also a challenge because I was trying not to buy every book. I wanted to rely more on the library system. But this made it almost impossible to stick with my pre-planned reading list because most were new releases and the waiting list at the library for those could be months long.</p>
<p>Note for myself to take into next year: Just buy a book if I feel like reading it (if I’m still employed anyway). I buy most books digitally these days so it’s not like I need to worry about them taking up space.</p>
<p>Overall I loved this page. I loved checking things off, I loved being able to look at it to help me choose what hobby to work on, removing the indecisions of what exactly that hobby would be. If I wanted to read in August I’d check this page and I would prioritise reading what I had chosen way back in January.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_FNw8" id="tasks">Tasks<a href="https://kymira.ca/blog/microjournaling#tasks" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Tasks" title="Direct link to Tasks">​</a></h2>
<p>On the page next to this one I broke it down by months once again. But this time with a to-do list for every month. This one wasn’t filled out at the start of the year like the previous page. It was filled up as responsibilities would arise.</p>
<p>The main goal of this page was to 1 - keep myself focused on the more immediate responsibilities and 2 - stop me from feeling overwhelmed by responsibility.</p>
<p>It’s easy to make a big list for trying to stay on top of everything in life, but that list could potentially be endless. So these lists had to be the things I didn’t want to do but really needed to. Also I tried to limit every month to 5 things. You can do 5 things in a month.</p>
<p>Sometimes this helped to get those big things done early in the month. A quick checkoff to feel good about myself and then coast on free time for the rest. Some of the items you can see really dragged. Getting carried over to multiple months because I never got around to it (the list isn’t magical, lol).</p>
<p>There is still one major outstanding task I didn’t complete: buying renters insurance. It’s something I really should do but it has multiple steps and involves phoning a company. A herculean task. But I keep copying it over, it keeps being one of my 5 things. Someday it will get done.</p>
<p>Really this to-do list approach was about being kind to myself. While it was an act to focus on what I needed to get done, it helped me to know when I could turn off the guilt of not being responsible and just enjoy my time. And by limiting how many goals I would have for a month it rarely meant I had a month that would feel overwhelming.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_FNw8" id="and-thats-microjournaling">And that’s microjournaling<a href="https://kymira.ca/blog/microjournaling#and-thats-microjournaling" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to And that’s microjournaling" title="Direct link to And that’s microjournaling">​</a></h2>
<p>I’m calling this microjournaling as it’s the smallest form of journaling I’ve tried. Smaller than a bullet?? It takes up one open page of a notebook and nothing else. It takes minimal effort to put together and works more as a reference or guide for making choices. I’m honestly super excited to fill out my page for next year. The only one I can usually fill in at the start is books because I have a huge backlog. For video games I check release dates and plan around those. The rest often get filled in as I find things I want to work on.</p>
<p>But a lot is still up to chance and where my interest takes me. It probably looks super rigid when shown like this, but I still felt like I had freedom to pursue my interests while feeling focused.</p>]]></content>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Favourite books of 2023]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I used to set myself much loftier goals for books read during the year. But I also used to buy many more physical books. These days I’ve prioritised reading on a Kobo due to ease and space. I’ve moved 7 times in the last 12 years, books make up for a lot of weight. I’ve even started to take my books to one of those free micro libraries. Boxes on the side of the street where you can take or leave books. At least the ones I don’t see myself ever re-reading. It’s helped free up space for… newer books.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Cover images of Iron Widow, Some Desperate Glory, and The Mountain in the Sea" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/2023-topbooks-fb9a233b937727689c8bb823ca7f07a3.jpg" width="1500" height="700" class="img_wQsy"></p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_FNw8" id="the-challenge">The challenge<a href="https://kymira.ca/blog/books-2023#the-challenge" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The challenge" title="Direct link to The challenge">​</a></h2>
<p>GoodReads always wants you to give yourself a challenge to read, to state how many books you’ll read in the following year. Knowing my reading habit was on the decline I haven’t been setting this very high. I just had 12 this year (and I’m still one short but suspect I’ll read 1 or 2 over winter break).</p>
<p>This year I really wanted to read the recent faves. Books that were making the lists of most anticipated or best of the year. After years of playing catchup I wanted to see if I could keep up with recent releases.</p>
<p>The answer is no, I couldn’t keep up. But also, since Twitter is dying and that’s where I get a lot of my book news and commentary, reading the hits of 2023 didn’t get me much extra engagement. I would have loved to hear other people’s thoughts on these books as they came out but when you spend less time on social media you end up less social. Go figure.</p>
<p>I don’t want to review all the books I read, I put small reviews up on <a href="https://app.thestorygraph.com/profile/lautir" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">StoryGraph</a> (the non-Amazon version of GoodRead) and also <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2315520-kylie" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GoodReads</a>. Here I’m just going to go over my top 3 for the year.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_FNw8" id="some-desperate-glory-by-emily-tesh"><a href="https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/c6402cfc-fff1-4b40-a30b-7ebe32871b68" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Some Desperate Glory by Emily Tesh</a><a href="https://kymira.ca/blog/books-2023#some-desperate-glory-by-emily-tesh" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to some-desperate-glory-by-emily-tesh" title="Direct link to some-desperate-glory-by-emily-tesh">​</a></h2>
<p>This book has been hitting many of the top sci-fi charts for the year. SDG starts out with your pretty typical sci-fi setup. A group of rebel humans fight and prepare for war against an alien race that destroyed their planet. Their sworn revenge keeps them going with small numbers and ageing technology.</p>
<p>It has strong Battlestar Galactica vibes. Military space opera. Not every kid in training gets to join the combat ranks, they are competing for placements. Some are confined to being breeding stock so that the resistance can keep their population alive.</p>
<p>The main character has extremely traditional views (very strong gender rules are enforced, most people on the station are white, and everyone who isn’t human is bad). Her world is turned upside down after an alien is captured and held prisoner, followed by her brother going AWOL. Setting off the chain of events of Kyr (our protagonist) having her eyes opened to the galaxy and what exists beyond her limited space station.</p>
<p>About a third of the way in, the book does a pretty big twist. So if the opening feels a little too basic (it kind of did for me), hold out till then.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_FNw8" id="iron-widow-by-xiran-jay-zhao"><a href="https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/8f403954-2950-4903-bdc3-cecb460279e2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Iron Widow by Xiran Jay Zhao</a><a href="https://kymira.ca/blog/books-2023#iron-widow-by-xiran-jay-zhao" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to iron-widow-by-xiran-jay-zhao" title="Direct link to iron-widow-by-xiran-jay-zhao">​</a></h2>
<p>It’s hard to beat the opening description line of Iron Widow on StoryGraph.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Pacific Rim meets The Handmaid’s Tale in this blend of Chinese history and mecha science fiction for YA readers.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Iron Widow goes hard. A leading character who wants more for herself. A better life, a better system of life. Giant robots powered by sucking the life out of a pair of drivers, tasked with defending civilization from a mysterious powerful threat.</p>
<p>We got death, violence, forced addiction, abuse of all sorts. Quickly followed by a love triangle, political manoeuvring and big plays for power. Everything plays out between gruesome fights and beautiful facades of the lives of pilots. Nowhere feels safe during the story. Even the ending doesn’t let you relax. So it’s a good thing that book 2 is on the way.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_FNw8" id="the-mountain-in-the-sea-by-ray-nayler"><a href="https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/ae637112-1291-493a-bc06-c1d313ae7d83" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Mountain in the Sea by Ray Nayler</a><a href="https://kymira.ca/blog/books-2023#the-mountain-in-the-sea-by-ray-nayler" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to the-mountain-in-the-sea-by-ray-nayler" title="Direct link to the-mountain-in-the-sea-by-ray-nayler">​</a></h2>
<p>This book caught my attention with this blurb before it was released.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Rumors begin to spread of a species of hyperintelligent, dangerous octopus that may have developed its own language and culture. Marine biologist Dr. Ha Nguyen, who has spent her life researching cephalopod intelligence, will do anything for the chance to study them.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If attending squid classes this year, my underwater themed D&amp;D campaign, and my collection of aquatic art hasn’t given it away, I’m in my cephalopod era. Which is how this and a few other ocean themed books ended up on my reading list. In my initial review I included this list of similar media:</p>
<p>You will like this if you enjoyed things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Arrival</li>
<li>Work by Becky Chambers</li>
<li>The world building of Malka Older</li>
</ul>
<p>The major themes of Mountain are language (Arrival) and ‘what is consciousness’ (I feel like Becky Chambers touched on this a bit though there are many others who do as well.). But the reason I included Becky Chambers here is that Ray has a strong human element in their sci-fi like Chambers does. A lot of time is spent thinking about how people exist with new technology and how it shapes life.</p>
<p>In Ray’s story, we are seeing 3 different types of life intersect. The humans, the very first near human passing android, and a group of octopuses. I’ve always had a love for androids living with or as humans in stories, this novel places androids right at the start of that journey. No one else is really writing about the development of octopus societies but that could change in the next few decades as we continue to learn more about them (fingers crossed).</p>

<p>I don’t have a strong focus for what to read next year yet. I have a few things I didn’t get to this year which I definitely want to get to. With my second goal being to read some of the physical books I’ve started to collect. But also maybe revisit some favourite writers from a few years ago who’ve I’ve ignored while trying to branch out and read the new folks rising up. Got a lot of Ann Leckie to catch up on…</p>]]></content>

        <updated>2023-12-11T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My review of 21Draw and its offerings.]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I paid around 80$ for a year subscription to 21 Draw, and it came with a free give away subscription which I was able to give to a friend. I had tried a few online learning programs over the years, more so when I was unemployed, but none with a year long commitment. I didn’t have any big plans for the year, I was going in with a kind of consistent job, a life still lived under semi-lockdown, and a longing to return to hobbies I’d struggled to get back into. I wasn’t sure how this was going to go but I had hoped that putting some money down would help motivate me, setting myself a goal of doing 1 course per month.</p>
<p>In the end, I finished 20 of the 24 courses I started.</p>
<p>There’s no way I could review all of them so I’m going to highlight my favourites in case anyone else wants to give 21Draw a chance.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_FNw8" id="what-makes-a-good-course">What makes a good course<a href="https://kymira.ca/blog/21draw-review#what-makes-a-good-course" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What makes a good course" title="Direct link to What makes a good course">​</a></h2>
<p>There are a few key points that make me view a course positively:</p>
<ul>
<li>Homework assignments feel worth my time and are present (I’m not building my 10th moodboard)</li>
<li>Lessons are short and have a take away (1 hour of watching someone paint isn’t my jam)</li>
<li>Something new is introduced</li>
</ul>
<p>I was a little surprised at how many of the courses didn’t have any homework and how lots of the illustrations were just watchings someone else work. You can definitely learn a lot from watching someone else work but if they aren’t well set up to show you the settings, brushes and techniques they are using, the take-aways are limited.</p>
<p>I also grew tired of how many courses started with the bare minimum of “this is how you use procreate”. It’s good the first time around, or when an artist explains a more complex or less used feature. But I think 21Draw could benefit from a series of “intro to software” lesson where the basics are covered in a stand alone course and then each artist doesn’t need to repeat the same info in the lessons.</p>

<p>Great at introducing ways to change the feel and story of the scene by using things like perspective, foreground background, and colour.</p>

<p>I wasn’t familiar with the process of starting from silhouettes before and this has very much changed my way of thinking about character and creature design. And now that I’ve seen it here I’m starting to see it everywhere from professional concept artists I watch. Just some really great, instantly applicable tricks to make your piece more interesting.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_FNw8" id="designing-fun-animal-characters"><a href="https://wwww.kymira.ca/blog/bean-approach/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Designing fun animal characters</a>:<a href="https://kymira.ca/blog/21draw-review#designing-fun-animal-characters" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to designing-fun-animal-characters" title="Direct link to designing-fun-animal-characters">​</a></h3>
<p>While this introduces a rather simple process for drawing cute characters, the base is really helpful for starting something new. Not only that, its limitations force you to become more creative with it.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_FNw8" id="landscapes"><a href="https://www.kymira.ca/blog/landscapes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Landscapes</a>:<a href="https://kymira.ca/blog/21draw-review#landscapes" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to landscapes" title="Direct link to landscapes">​</a></h3>
<p>I knew nothing about landscapes before this course and now it’s become one of my most common art types of the year. I loved working in greyscale and the slow refinement process that’s introduced really helps make landscapes less intimidating.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_FNw8" id="mastering-lighting"><a href="https://kymira.ca/blog/learning-light/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mastering lighting</a>:<a href="https://kymira.ca/blog/21draw-review#mastering-lighting" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to mastering-lighting" title="Direct link to mastering-lighting">​</a></h3>
<p>I thought I had a pretty good grasp of light but this course taught me I knew nothing. Covers the terminology for different kinds of light and shadows while showing how to incorporate them into a piece. I had no idea what Mask layers were for before this.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_FNw8" id="intro-to-animation"><a href="https://kymira.ca/blog/2d-animation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Intro to animation</a>:<a href="https://kymira.ca/blog/21draw-review#intro-to-animation" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to intro-to-animation" title="Direct link to intro-to-animation">​</a></h3>
<p>After watching multiple intro to animation videos this year I feel like I can confidently say that this one does a good job of covering the main concepts of 2d animation. The assignments were good and I felt like I took away a lot of new knowledge from this one.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="The 4 pieces from the light lesson" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/Lighting-studies-d2f864afb8a5348525e6633403d09a44.jpg" width="9921" height="2480" class="img_wQsy"></p>

<p>I’m extremely happy with my 21Draw purchase. There was certainly a variety of quality when it came to the courses. It felt like some had more support than others when being made. And if you take a lot of intro level courses you end up hearing the same intro level content on repeat. It’s a gamble I was willing to take, with the decent sized catalogue of courses there was always something new to try if there was a course that wasn’t working for me.</p>
<p>I won’t be renewing my subscription for a 2nd year as I think there’s only 10 courses left that I haven’t checked out. I’m eyeing up the learning platform <a href="https://www.domestika.org/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Domestika</a> for my 2024 learning. I do plan to keep an eye on 21Draw releases over the next year, and if they get a few more interesting ones I could see signing up again in the future for the next content.</p>
<p>However, one major thing has stood out while doing this year in review. I have much fewer completed pieces than I would like.</p>
<p>This is mostly my fault, I didn’t do all the assigned homeworks and baulked at having to do 1 full illustration for a course instead of smaller pieces or homeworks. So while Domestika looks really fun, I’m also considering doing a few months of focused practice instead of focused learning.</p>
<p>21Draw was a great way to re-familiarize myself with the basics and also many of the steps of the process I never learned. But when a course is 7 hours long and it’s mostly just watching someone else work, that 7 hours I don’t spend drawing myself.</p>
<p>I think for January I’m going to try to follow a practice schedule, specifically the one Jacob Drawfee goes over in this Drawclass: Jacob's No Pressure Guide to Learning How to Enjoy Art Practice.</p>

<p>It boils down to trying to draw 5 days out of the week, with a specific focus for the week and what to do each day. I’d love to say I’ll commit to a year of it but that feels rather intimidating at the moment. Especially with a few projects and volunteer programs in the works for 2024. So we’ll see how far I can get. And if each week might make for a worthy blog post.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>October ended up being one of my busiest months of the year, which led to only sporadic 21 Draw lessons between travelling and playing Baldur’s Gate 3.</p>
<p>In December I plan to do a few end of year posts which means I want to try to cover the last 2 months of art practice in this post. So buckle in for some random courses and projects from the last 2 months.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_FNw8" id="21-draw---pets">21 Draw - Pets<a href="https://kymira.ca/blog/catch-up#21-draw---pets" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 21 Draw - Pets" title="Direct link to 21 Draw - Pets">​</a></h2>
<p>Multiple new courses have launched on 21 Draw during my year of taking classes which has been very exciting. If a little disruptive to my early plans of having pre-chosen which courses I wanted to focus on. One of these was a course on creating cartoon versions of pets.</p>
<p>I don’t have a cat or dog but I have a friend who sends me lots of photos of her cats so I had a lot of material to work with as reference. I didn’t finish this course as I found things start to get pretty repetitive when the artist is covering basic line-art and painting techniques. But the more central part of the program, breaking animals down into basic shapes and ways to portray age and personality with some design choices were helpful.</p>
<p>I ended up only working on the sketch phases with the references I had. I do love drawing animals but doing simplifications or cartoonification is definitely a weakness of mine. I struggle to choose what details aren’t important and can be left out. And I struggle to make eyes larger for soften personalities instead of trying to replicate sizes to proper anatomical proportions.</p>

<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_FNw8" id="21-draw---colour-theory--intermediate-procreate">21 Draw - Colour Theory &amp; Intermediate Procreate<a href="https://kymira.ca/blog/catch-up#21-draw---colour-theory--intermediate-procreate" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 21 Draw - Colour Theory &amp; Intermediate Procreate" title="Direct link to 21 Draw - Colour Theory &amp; Intermediate Procreate">​</a></h2>
<p>I started and nearly finished it (I’ll probably wrap it up next week), a short course of colour theory. A few of the longer digital painting lessons touched on colour theory so a lot of this was repeat information to me but it had a few gems still. Colour theory is something I over think, or that there is some mystical secret behind. But I feel like it really comes down to understanding the colour wheel and having a good eye for colour. I’ve been forcing myself to work with palettes a little more in my last few pieces as well as to use the Procreate colour selector to check complementary and tertiary colours for my main colour themes.</p>
<p>This had a few pieces of homework but none of them interested me so I didn’t do them. I probably should have for the practice but I felt like I had multiple courses on the go at this point and was struggling to focus on putting Apple pencil to tablet.</p>
<p>I’m not super confident in my colour selection of pieces, I probably go way too saturated most of the time. And then jump around to whatever colour I like instead of taking the time to see if colours work well together.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/schmoedraws/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Simone Grünewald</a>’s intermediate Procreate lesson has been pretty good but it’s hard to focus on a 5 hour course with no homework assignments. The main thing this course did for me was convince me to buy <a href="https://maxpacks.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Max Ulichney’s Watercolor Brushes for Procreate</a>. Simone used these for nearly her whole painting process and I really came around to how they looked and behaved during the main hours I watched her paint.</p>

<p>These pieces were small projects during the year I didn’t post about as they contain spoilers for the D&amp;D campaign I’m running. They’re maps that are meant to convey locations of places easily to players instead of a battle map. I’ll often find battle maps online for my needs but for more unique locations I want to be able to communicate the area I’ve created and find that this can be more reliably done with images. Hence spending way too much time on these maps that the players may never fully see.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Exploration grid map of a sunken island city" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/Ruins-map-8572cdf1902a2b3c8524888437daf1d4.jpg" width="1408" height="1408" class="img_wQsy"></p>

<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_FNw8" id="altar-stone-projects">Altar Stone Projects<a href="https://kymira.ca/blog/catch-up#altar-stone-projects" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Altar Stone Projects" title="Direct link to Altar Stone Projects">​</a></h2>
<p>It’s been a while since we launched a new song (see October being busy) but I’ve been picking away at putting together scenes for future music.</p>
<p>One project started with a fish sheet.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="A sheet of a variety of pink fish." src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/Fish-sheet-b91cc4a190a4cf1c945ab06324a920fd.jpg" width="2500" height="2500" class="img_wQsy"></p>
<p>I love seeing other artists' sheets of creatures. There’s often so much variety to each creature and everyone interprets them all a little differently. My fish sheet is all fictional creatures as I wanted to build up a repertoire of basic fish to have around in the D&amp;D campaign. So I spent a lot of time looking at fish and then smashing together my favourite bits of real fish to make up these fake fish.</p>
<p>Then I started to animate them.</p>
<p>Not all of them, but so far I’ve created simple animation loops for at least 6 of them. Then I made them a place to swim.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="An underwater scene of rocks, sea weed, and a dome in the distance." src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/Underwater-arch-a30bf84ca1be7ed740c1c5cfe5fdabc4.jpg" width="3840" height="2160" class="img_wQsy"></p>
<p>I’ve put together this full animated scene already but it’s not online yet, so you’ll have to wait to see the completed piece.</p>
<p>Next up was a player request. I introduced a giant awoken octopus as a smith in my underwater city. People thought he was pretty cool and asked if he had a themed song (he did not). But my girlfriend went ahead and tried a few things to put together something that could capture a forge vibe.</p>
<p>For this piece I really wanted to try out the MaxU watercolour brushes I mentioned above. They seem well fitted for background work and I wanted something more gritty and textual than my previous background pieces. This did mean it took much longer as I had both a learning process to get through and many layers to work with to get the right blend of colours and textures from the brushes.</p>
<p>I’m not super satisfied with the final product, I know what areas I want to touch up, but I’m leaving them for the animation edits so that I can play with lighting more dynamically instead of having it painted on directly. Hilariously enough, the large octopus going in front of this will cover most of the background anyway.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="A scene of a large medieval looking furnace in a forge." src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/Forge-bg-e3bea4e679984c989a3111773dc1e1a0.jpg" width="5760" height="3240" class="img_wQsy"></p>

<p>I'm hoping to squeeze in one more 21 Draw course between November and December. Then my subscription will come to an end. I'm already making plans for 2024 and what I want to focus on but we'll see how well those plans hold up. After a year of trying out a lot of different stuff, I can see myself ending back up at figure drawing lessons once again.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A few months ago my girlfriend asked if I could draw a piece of art to be the image of a YouTube video for her music. She was composing a fight track for a D&amp;D campaign I run and since I use Sync-Tube to sync music with my players during a game, uploading the track to YouTube was the easiest way to share it. But this meant having a visual aspect to the music as well.</p>
<p>An idea came to mind pretty quickly for this and I was able to put it almost all tonight in an evening. A large octopus with a sword fight with silhouettes of the characters from the campaign:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="A giant pink octopus holding a sword, facing off 5 silhouettes of adventurers." src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/octo-fight1-e9bfb0e0ab5de4368895a702abd9c8d4.jpg" width="2986" height="2242" class="img_wQsy"></p>
<p>Before we got around to uploading the song, she got the idea to try animating a part of it so it wasn’t just a static image for 1 hour. I cut out the sword as a separate layer, she put both pieces into PowerPoint and ta-da, we got a spinning sword:</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mE8iykMUzuk?si=TsYqWsZYlsXYJqLc" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"></iframe>
<p>With the publication of this first video, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@altarstone" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Project Altar Stone</a> was launched, and so began my focus on 2D animation.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_FNw8" id="from-powerpoint-to-toonsquid">From PowerPoint to ToonSquid<a href="https://kymira.ca/blog/2d-animation#from-powerpoint-to-toonsquid" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to From PowerPoint to ToonSquid" title="Direct link to From PowerPoint to ToonSquid">​</a></h2>
<p>As mentioned, my girlfriend animated the first video in PowerPoint and this worked surprisingly well. But PowerPoint has its limitations (you can only animate one thing at a time) and I already had ideas for how the next video could go. I have some video editing experience with a program called Camtasia so this is what I brought the next song project into.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Camtasia was rather limited on the animation front as it’s more designed for traditional video editing (doing green screens, layovers, highlighting mouse movements). I was using it to make tutorial videos at a previous job. But since I had a paid version of this software I was hoping to make it work. After some Googling I learned that my version was a few updates behind and if I wanted to find tutorials or troubleshoot issues I would almost always be finding ones that reference the new version.</p>
<p>And so the hunt for 2D animation software began.</p>
<p>Since I do almost all my digital art on an iPad these days, that’s where the search started. It’s pretty easy to find a top 10 best animation apps list, but still hard to choose one when you don’t really know what features of an app you want are. So I read some guides, watched some videos and eventually settled on a rather recent new program <a href="https://toonsquid.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ToonSquid</a>.</p>
<p>ToonSquid has a few short tutorials on YouTube, keywords I understood (keyframes, onions layers) and a rather impressive intro demo video. And possibly it’s biggest selling point, it was a one time purchase instead of a subscription model! So with that research phase done, it was on to video number 2.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_FNw8" id="learning-the-tools-of-the-trade">Learning the tools of the trade<a href="https://kymira.ca/blog/2d-animation#learning-the-tools-of-the-trade" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Learning the tools of the trade" title="Direct link to Learning the tools of the trade">​</a></h2>
<p>With ToonSquid came a lot of learning, watching tutorial videos, experimenting with tools, etc. Our second video came from both of us learning how to use ToonSquid. Definitely had some struggles so this process felt a little messy but resulted in us learning some best practices to take forward into the next one.</p>
<p>Even with those learning hiccups, I’m pretty happy with how the video came out with two major objects being animated at once. And it was a good challenge for me to learn to draw and design a fantasy submarine, something I felt pretty scared to do.</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OYB_MDRmDq4?si=kDrBCzfaOKHnlj_0" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"></iframe>
<p>Video three is rather simple from an animation perspective, but was a big challenge for me as I set myself the goal of drawing an alleyway for a world I didn’t have a great visual grasp of. Did a lot of Pinterest searching for ‘fantasy market’ and ‘fantasy alleyway’ to get ideas. Then it was time to get familiar with the perspective tools Procreate has to offer. These ended up great for blocking in the basic shapes and helping to get the lines of the boxes and door at the right angle.</p>
<p>Other things I learned in this one was how to make repeating pattern blocks, which is how I made the cobblestone road. This took some precise copy and pasting which I didn’t love as it was easy to mess up the seam lines. But it was cool to learn the basic approach for making repeating patterns.</p>

<p>(There is a second version of this video with more animations but it’s a secret until a specific D&amp;D session.)</p>
<p>Video three is a return to combat which meant revisiting our very first scene. Coming at this with the knowledge learned from the first three videos made this more complex and also easier. I knew exactly what I needed to be separate layers which would give me lots of options to play with when moving over to ToonSquid. This did result in me hitting the Procreate layer limit for the first time ever, oops. My big mistake in this one is that I did too much shading on the tentacles which completely falls apart once things start moving. Still need to remind myself to not think of these images as static.</p>
<p>Thanks to all the layers, this is our most active video yet. 8 different tentacles moving at once, the octopus mantle moves a bit, and even got the octopus eyes moving about.</p>

<p>When I started going through the 21 Draw course offerings I hadn’t really considered taking the intro to 2D animation one, but once this project started to take off I added it to my queue. It had a lot of the foundational stuff that was covered by the same teacher in his other courses and that I’ve blogged about before. But he spent more time on the 12 Principles of Animation from Disney and ran through what seems like some of the classic beginner animation challenges.</p>
<p>I enjoy the practice of starting off learning to animate with a flour sack. For the assignment he gave us making the sack jump:</p>
<img src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/Sack-jump-47f3d2fc42c0f5ffd907fe1821d68614.gif" width="400">
<p>Then we ran through a longer thumbnailing exercise of laying out the key frames of a longer animation. Rabbit character picks up a piece of paper and then <del>something happens</del> left up for the learner to decide:</p>

<p>While the idea of doing a large flip book project is very daunting, it’s something that now feels doable. I was complaining previously about sometimes only having 20 minutes to get some drawing time in and while working on animations 20 minutes felt like a decent amount of time to get a frame or two done. Sure if I think about how little a single frame is seen it can make that kind of work feel less rewarding, but seeing a small animation play out has been a lot of fun.</p>
<p>I’m now in the brainstorming phase for future song animations while spending time on YouTube looking for more intro to 2D animation tutorials. Now trying to balance working on animation while still trying to do one or two 21 Draw courses every month.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After getting through a large portion of the beginner level courses on 21 Draw, I finally felt like I could start dipping into the intermediate level courses. Starting with <a href="https://www.avelinestokart.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aveline Stokart’s</a> ‘Mastering Lighting and Shading’.</p>
<p>This is one of 21 Draws top highlighted courses, a large portion of it is even available for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdMxg3lVGGI" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">free on YouTube</a>. Now that I’ve completed the whole thing it definitely deserves the top slot on the website and I would highly recommend it for anyone who wants to get more creative with lighting in their illustrations.</p>
<p>It starts by walking you through the basics of light and shadows on simple shapes. I always forget the specific names for different types of light and shadows so this was good for me, even if I’ve forgotten half of the names already. Then we did some studies of movie scenes to grasp light in action and after that Aveline provides a sketch that you then use to create 4 different lighting scenarios which is where the real takeaways come from.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_FNw8" id="learning-to-see-light">Learning to see light<a href="https://kymira.ca/blog/learning-light#learning-to-see-light" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Learning to see light" title="Direct link to Learning to see light">​</a></h2>
<p>One of the exercises that Aveline gives is to study movie shots. This has come up before in other courses for studying composition and colours, but her approach was all about understanding how light was being used in the scene. Be it to highlight something specific in the scene to draw the eye or set the tone.</p>
<p>I chose this Black Swan shot for my study because I wanted something simple to get through the exercises quickly.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="A screenshot from the movie Black Swan next to a digital painting copy." src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/black-swan-study-f8b90c4ceb435c4f03fdd94214dba2a5.jpg" width="2048" height="774" class="img_wQsy"></p>
<p>I don’t like it when I look at it in full size as the colours are all off, but every time I see this in thumbnail form on the Procreate project selection screen it looks pretty good!</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_FNw8" id="the-base">The base<a href="https://kymira.ca/blog/learning-light#the-base" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The base" title="Direct link to The base">​</a></h2>
<p>The base sketch is a girl with a small dragon. We filled in the flats, gave it a simple background and filled in some details like the cookie box and her shirt.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Character in a park on a sunny day." src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/base-light-colors-0553906978d28f1cc829c04ace833598.jpg" width="2480" height="2480" class="img_wQsy"></p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_FNw8" id="scenario-1-sunny-day">Scenario 1: Sunny day<a href="https://kymira.ca/blog/learning-light#scenario-1-sunny-day" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Scenario 1: Sunny day" title="Direct link to Scenario 1: Sunny day">​</a></h2>
<p>The first lighting scenario was a bright sunny day with the light coming through between the tree branches. It was in this first explainer video that I learned how many layers it takes to do light well. I think Aveline used over 10 different layers to pull off this look. That’s layers for bounce light, ambient light, specular light, general highlights, and on and on.</p>
<p>I’d never worked with Mask layers before so this was an interesting one to see right from the start. And makes a lot of sense given a lesson I picked up from a different course: Lighting is more about erasing than painting. You carve out the areas being hit by light. I’ve done that in the past to create minor vignette effects but to see it used to create the main light regions in an illustration was something else!</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Character in a park on a sunny day." src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/Sunny_Day-e61fbf9d770943c779e5e639e393a200.jpg" width="2480" height="2480" class="img_wQsy"></p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_FNw8" id="scenario-2-night---glow">Scenario 2: Night - Glow<a href="https://kymira.ca/blog/learning-light#scenario-2-night---glow" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Scenario 2: Night - Glow" title="Direct link to Scenario 2: Night - Glow">​</a></h2>
<p>In the second challenge the bright day is completely flipped for a dark night. The lighting layers are all deleted, we keep the base colours around, and start again.</p>
<p>I generally find glows really fun to work with in digital art. There are lots of options to play with and room for experimentation. In this scene it’s the little dragon giving off the glow so we have the direction of the light change from the first scene. The light is also more tinted then the light of the sun so the whole scene feels drastically shifted away from the vibrant day.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Character outside in the dark with a glowing dragon." src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/Magic_Night-77a7089dbc5a9a09304bb916a8d3297e.jpg" width="2480" height="2480" class="img_wQsy"></p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_FNw8" id="scenario-3-indoors---overcast">Scenario 3: Indoors - Overcast<a href="https://kymira.ca/blog/learning-light#scenario-3-indoors---overcast" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Scenario 3: Indoors - Overcast" title="Direct link to Scenario 3: Indoors - Overcast">​</a></h2>
<p>For scenes 3 and 4 we’ve moved inside. So quickly through a new background together; walls and some hanging art.</p>
<p>Same approach, delete all the previous lighting layers, choose a new ambient base colour and start adding layers. I think I went a little too dark on this one, it’s pretty easy to over shoot a colour and a good opacity level.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Character inside on an overcast day." src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/Overcast-88cc45857901c5e6e10869c8d22caabc.jpg" width="2480" height="2480" class="img_wQsy"></p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_FNw8" id="scenario-4-indoors---sunset">Scenario 4: Indoors - Sunset<a href="https://kymira.ca/blog/learning-light#scenario-4-indoors---sunset" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Scenario 4: Indoors - Sunset" title="Direct link to Scenario 4: Indoors - Sunset">​</a></h2>
<p>Now going to warm colours for a sunset vibe that’s much more intense then the overcast day in the previous one. Both of these scenarios moved to a more backlit character and I may have lost details in the girl's face. One of the other important tips, which I still struggled to execute, is when it’s okay to cheat.</p>
<p>You can live by the realistic movements of light and shadows but if you want to balance your piece and have the important parts pop, it’s good to “cheat” by adding highlights to locations that need it to stand out. You still follow the rules of the scene, where the lights are coming from, colour, etc. But if it means putting a bit of highlight on a dark face to make a face more visible, it’s usually the right call.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Character inside while the sun sets." src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/Sunset-4c7044000579967a4a9f5dee3679bf0e.jpg" width="2480" height="2480" class="img_wQsy"></p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_FNw8" id="conclusion">Conclusion<a href="https://kymira.ca/blog/learning-light#conclusion" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Conclusion" title="Direct link to Conclusion">​</a></h2>
<p>Before this course I didn’t think about light too much. I always have a mental map of where light is coming from when shading a character and thought was enough. And sure it was fine for rather flat character work, but going through all the steps to add even baseline lighting to these scenes has reinforced how much heavy lifting lighting does to create a scene and vibe. I feel less afraid to tackle a whole illustration now, and maybe take a few more daring approaches to lighting characters in the future.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>While this is one of the most popular courses on 21 Draw I didn’t prioritise it. My interests had always been more around character design and creatures. But after branching out in a few other courses, I thought it would be time to keep trying to step out of my comfort zone.</p>
<p>This course is taught by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCI2LeV6oDbGd8LJ8iUneSZA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Philip Sue</a> and it looks like he has a lot of step by step process videos on his YouTube which likely cover a lot of the things covered in this course.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_FNw8" id="greyscales">Greyscales<a href="https://kymira.ca/blog/landscapes#greyscales" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Greyscales" title="Direct link to Greyscales">​</a></h2>
<p>Just like in a lot of the other courses I’ve taken so far, this one started out with silhouettes. It was a pretty free form first exercise, work with the 5 tones to compose a background, midground, and foreground. The assignment pushed you to make five different pieces which was a good stretch and quickly where I started to diverge a little too much from the guidelines.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Figuring out compositions with greyscale work" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/Landscape-thumbnails-02ac4464f666db17b5e172ef3abd4961.jpg" width="1408" height="939" class="img_wQsy"></p>
<p>My first few landscapes felt reasonable, but then I started to get ideas for D&amp;D game locations. These started off problematic as I was too “zoomed in” to follow lots of the advice that was being provided for landscapes. They could probably work as general illustrations but there wasn’t enough distance between the features to really follow the next steps. Which is what pushed me to continue with only 2 pieces instead of 3 like the course suggested.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_FNw8" id="colours">Colours<a href="https://kymira.ca/blog/landscapes#colours" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Colours" title="Direct link to Colours">​</a></h2>
<p>THe courses provided some palettes to try out but I didn’t want to screenshot the video and then pull the colours into Clip Studio so I looked up some other palettes on Pinterest. These weren’t as curated so it was actually more time confusing and not super rewarding. The orange, desert-y one was from the instructor while my green ring ended up being mostly eye balled. But I was at least happy to have 2 very different colourscapes to work with.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Laying down base colours over the grey thumbnails" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/Landscapes-lighting-v1-efd02817f14d460ea0b04f57dba4aaba.jpg" width="1408" height="1033" class="img_wQsy"></p>
<p>There was a step for experimenting with colours and lighting, and I would have loved to have access to Procreate's Gradient Maps for that, but in Clip I played around with colours layers and some manual re-painting. I had always thought I had a pretty good natural grasp of lighting but on trying to get more creative with it in these scenes I started to question that. Good thing there’s a whole class on lighting that I can still take.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_FNw8" id="detailing">Detailing<a href="https://kymira.ca/blog/landscapes#detailing" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Detailing" title="Direct link to Detailing">​</a></h2>
<p>After composition and colours comes making the thumbnail huge and getting into the details.</p>
<p>The first one, my desert, thankfully doesn’t have many details going on. Touched up the lighting, added some extra rocks and made a very simple stream. I probably spent just as much time looking for nice cloud brushes. It definitely took a while to get used to the movements of painting and erasing over and over again to try to create the right shapes in the mountains, and I still don’t feel like I nailed that, but I feel like I’m getting closer at least. I re-painted a few of them a few times, trying out different brushes and techniques. Most of them ended up smoothing things out too much and losing the rock-like texture of large sweeping strokes. Which feels like the largest challenge of painting like this, you kind of want to work minimally as more strokes or colours ends up washing out the sharp lines and features.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Final version of my desert" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/Desert-landscape-3567c2c3d6fb15aeae01f2098ddd4436.jpg" width="4286" height="2997" class="img_wQsy"></p>
<p>I’m pretty happy with how this came out in the end. There are definitely areas I can see improvements for already, but it feels “big” which is what I wanted to learn to do in this course.</p>
<p>For my green pieces I felt like I had fallen into my “too zoomed in” habit here a bit too. I ended up spending a lot of time on detailing the big stone ring, and adding plant textures with plant brushes. All the while I should have been working further out to a point of not seeing any of these details.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Final version of my forest ring" src="https://kymira.ca/assets/images/Ring-landscape-70cd300ec10f30ba7e7d3ea289897bb0.jpg" width="4562" height="2983" class="img_wQsy"></p>
<p>I also struggled with the colour balance a bit more here. I wanted the sun to be rising behind the mountains which made for minimal light hitting the side we could actually see. And some of the mountains felt like they started to disappear, which I guess makes sense if the light is so bright behind them, but I ended up darkening up a lot of features so that the lines between layers of distance still made sense.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_FNw8" id="final-review">Final review<a href="https://kymira.ca/blog/landscapes#final-review" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Final review" title="Direct link to Final review">​</a></h2>
<p>Overall I found this course had the perfect balance of lesson + homework. It had some great foundational takeaways and you could instantly apply what was being taught. I struggled a little bit with the program being Photoshop in the course, but nearly all the features also exist in Clip Studio so it was just a matter of figuring out the right tool or button to accomplish the task. The course managed to really break down how to approach landscapes and now I no longer feel intimidated by them. Will definitely draw more in the future.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The mixed media course on 21 Draw launched a little over a month ago now. It’s their first mixed media course which was enough to make me want to give it a try. And it focused on strange creatures so it had a lot going for it in my eyes. It ended up being one of the more detailed courses I’ve taken so far.</p>
<p>The course is hosted by <a href="https://www.evaboneva.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Eva Toorenent</a>, an artist with a very unique approach to mixing watercolours with digital colouring. I’ve never done any serious watercolour practice before so I was excited at the possibility of learning a new medium.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_FNw8" id="inspiration">Inspiration<a href="https://kymira.ca/blog/mixed-media-monsters#inspiration" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Inspiration" title="Direct link to Inspiration">​</a></h2>
<p>The first assignment of the course was 2 questions. I find these things rather cheesy and would usually skip them, but as I said in my previous blog post, doing these courses is my attempt to slow down and do the work.</p>
<p><strong>Question 1: What gets you excited/happy? What can you talk about for hours? (5 sentences)</strong></p>
<p>This is a kind of ironic one because I recently told my girlfriend “I don’t feel joy” and I kind of mean it but in a way that I just don’t get super excited about things. I can feel joy or happiness in the moment, I look forward to things in the future, but I rarely feel really <em>excited</em> about it.</p>
<p>The biggest one is probably playing D&amp;D. It’s a solid combo of creativity, fast thinking and social time. It’s probably also one of the few things I could talk about for hours.</p>
<p>I have a lot of practice talking about myself thanks to over 100 hours of therapy but I can’t say that that’s a topic that I’m excited about. I also get very excited to eat take-out but couldn’t talk about that for hours unless we’re looking for recommendations.</p>
<p>It’s funny because I do love to read, watch tv, play video games, and just consume media in general but I don’t go out of my way to talk about it for more than a few minutes. I’ve always been a big Solo Enjoyer.</p>
<p><strong>Question 2: What do you do to get inspired? (5 things)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Read blogs / adventures written by other DMs (D&amp;D)</li>
<li>Stare out the window (in hopes of seeing animals)</li>
<li>Listen to podcasts</li>
<li>Look at my previous projects</li>
<li>Talk about ideas with other people</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Question 3: 3 artists that inspire your work</strong>
I quickly knew this wasn’t a question I was prepared to answer. Which made me wonder if maybe it’s a reason why I feel all over the place with style. I don’t have any artists I follow really closely or ones I’ve done a deep dive on their methods. But I do have a Twitter list with 100 artists whose art I like. I can’t say they all inspire my art. So it took a long time to find some answers to this:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/frandaredoodles" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fran Dare</a></li>
</ol>
<p>Fran used to run #drowgust over on Twitter every year, it was one of the first art month challenges that I managed to complete. They draw an endless amount of drow (and so was I a few years ago) and I really loved their greyscale approach to traditional pieces. They are probably a big reason why I own so many grey markers.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Drawfee" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Drawfee team</a></li>
</ol>
<p>Drawfee is a show that’s been around online for ages but I only started watching it last year. They are digital art focused, which is often how I work. They mostly draw characters or silly scenes, which is basically where I want to get comfortable with my drawings. But since they do speedraws every now and then you can watch their process, hear about how they troubleshoot an image and see them push their own artistic boundaries. Watching their episodes every week is definitely one of the big reasons why I made this year an art focused year.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>???</li>
</ol>
<p>Honestly couldn’t come up with anyone else. Back in the days of DeviantArt and blogs it was much easier to follow artists and learn about their process. I’m not a huge fan of historical artists so I’m not off reading about the progression of the Old Masters. A decent take away from this question is that I probably want to find some time to do research on artists, see who has good YouTube content, see if anyone is blogging about their work. Learn more about other people's approaches to find new directions to take my own practice.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_FNw8" id="inspiration-and-reference-material">Inspiration and reference material<a href="https://kymira.ca/blog/mixed-media-monsters#inspiration-and-reference-material" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Inspiration and reference material" title="Direct link to Inspiration and reference material">​</a></h2>
<p>Like most of the courses this one tasks you with creating a moodboard and even a playlist. Since the mood boards were focused on one for real animals and one for monsters I spent some time building these up with images I like. I didn’t bother to make a playlist as I find this very time consuming and not super helpful to my own process.</p>
<p>It was around this point that I realised how many different assignments there were going to be in this course. There was a blob challenge, which I did. But she says don’t even bother to do this unless you know you are then going to work on a larger piece after. And in my case, I almost never have that much time on my hands to spend 20 minutes doing a blob challenge. Followed by a requested <strong>five</strong> pages of sketches to get ideas down. Then on top of that, choosing 3-5 and giving those characters a story related phrase to say.</p>
<p>I understand that this is a course very closely following a particular artist's approach to their work but at this point the course was losing focus for me. Wasn’t jiving with the process. I wanted to get to the technical takeaways. I know this comes a lot from my own impatience, but it’s also clear that these are approaches for people who can spend 2-5 hours doing creative projects. I don’t have that kind of time so I need to find my own approach.</p>

<p>I did the blob challenge twice. The first time when I had limited time and the second time on a rare quiet morning. I still really do enjoy this challenge, even though I often feel head empty when I first see the shapes. I'm usually pretty pleased with one of them by the end of it.</p>

<p>Then I went to my Pinterest boards and started sketching. At first I would take one idea from each monster while scrolling. Other times I would attempt to reacted a whole creature if it felt like a good challenge. Then I stared to take single pieces and try to build up something larger just using my own ideas. Then I just drew some jellyfish.</p>

<p>I chose the moth guy to be the piece of this course. Simple enough that I felt confident I could recreate it in a new sketch. But before that I had to drop 150$ on watercolour supplies. Just had too.</p>
<p>I had tried using the Aquarelle Watercolour Pencils I already owned but found I still struggled with understanding the right way to use these. I probably could have looked up some tutorials online but other then a new sketchbook I hadn't bought any new art materials since started these classes 6 months ago. Felt like a reasonable time to put some money into the hobby, especially if it was going to help motivate me in a course.</p>

<p>Moth guy, who I started to call Mothmon because I felt he had Digimon design energy, got researched and then painted. Snapped a photo and then brought the painting into Procreate.</p>

<p>It's here that Eva's mix media technique really starts to shine. She's all about doing small adjustments and touch ups or additions that blend in with the existing piece. With the goal of making everything look like it could still be a traditional art piece. And choosing when to push past that line with some stronger digital techniques.</p>
<p>This is a very slow process, and I worked very zoomed in on the screen to try to keep the touchups subtle. But once I zoomed out and did a before and after comparison I started to feel pretty happy about how everything was coming together.</p>

<p>I put a few hours into touching up Mothmon before decided to call it quits on the piece. The most time I've put into a work for a while. Since I was still riding the excitement of a new art supply purchase I returned to the new watercolours the next weekend to keep practicing how to use them.</p>
<p>Maybe it was because this course was still fresh in my mind, but I stumbled across an illustrator who I found wildly inspiring just after finishing the Mothmon piece. <a href="https://www.instagram.com/josephine__draws/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Josephine__Draws</a> on Instagram. They do gorgeous monochrome pieces, mostly focused on animals, bones, and shells. They work with very strong lines while mixing in watercolour elements. The kind of stuff that makes me want to pick up a pencil and draw whenever I see it.</p>
<p>They sadly don't have much of an online presence beyond their Instagram page so I'm going to have to survive on their short looping videos.</p>]]></content>
