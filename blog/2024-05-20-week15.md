I’m two weeks behind on blog posts so I’m gonna keep these two rather short to get them out. This week was another childhood animal revisit: Penguins.

## Day 1 - Drawing from imagination

Penguins were honestly pretty easy from the get go. They have a pretty iconic yet simple shape. However, non of these day one guys are any specific species of penguin and are more just my mental model for what a penguin is.

## Day 2 - Figure sketching

I did struggle with movement on day 1. Other than walk around, stand around, and swim, what to penguins do? I had forgotten about how more active they could look when moving about.

## Day 3 - Reference studies

By this day I’m starting to wonder if I should have chosen a specific species to focus on as there is a fair bit of variety between different penguins.

## Day 4 - Style studies

I made a mistake here in that a lot of the styled images are baby penguins. Very cute but I hadn’t meant for that to become the focus.

## Day 5 - Drawing from imagination

This is one of the first times where I feel like there is almost zero change from day 1 to day 5. Partially due to the lack of pose options and partially because I really rushed through this day 5. I’m not sure if I should force myself to get day 5 done in a sloppy way or if not even doing it is better as I’m unlikely to learn anything if I just force something on paper without giving it conscious thought.
