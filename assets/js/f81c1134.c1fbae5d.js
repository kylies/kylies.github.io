A slightly different approach from my Root week as I found this style much more difficult and just mentally draining because of how central the line art is to the style.\\n\\nMain focuses for the week:\\n\\n* Line art style  \\n* Colours  \\n* Ink black shadows\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## Research\\n\\nI knew this would be a pretty easy art style to research because Hades is so beloved. So there are multiple videos of people breaking down the style, people sharing their research, others compiling a list of inspiration and techniques used from multiple interviews with the art director.\\n\\nWhich is an amazing amount of resources to learn from, but because this is an official in-house style used by multiple artists, there aren\u2019t really first hand reports from them. Which I think makes sense because while the style is going to be replicated, you don\u2019t need to make it super easy for people to make knock-offs.\\n\\nThere is however one very short sequence in [episode 3 of the the Developing Hell](https://youtu.be/oQPk9J7spw0?si=3PLDkZbc8TjjvVIh&t=831) documentary that shows the layers coming together on Jen Zee\u2019s screen.\\n\\n### Style inspiration\\n\\nWhile I did 5 years of art in highschool, I never really learned much about\u2026 art styles. Our teacher touched on a few classical artists but there was a big push to focus on Canadian content so the only artists I know are like The Group of Seven.\\n\\nBecause of that it makes learning about professional artist inspirations all the more beneficial. These are some of the names that came up when Jen Zee talk\u2019s about the inspiration for Hades\u2019s look:\\n\\n- Mike Mignola (Specifically inspired the direction of the Hades art)  \\n- Yoji Shinkawa (For his strongly sculpted character art)  \\n- Fred Taylor (For his use of colour and setting)\\n\\nThen there were a few art techniques and inspirations that have also been identified by artists or mentioned by the team. And have been put into a huge list [in this Point n\u2019 Click blog post](https://www.pointnthink.fr/en/the-art-of-hades-en/). Covering things like classic Greek statues, the importance of diversity, pottery art, and the myths themselves.\\n\\nAs someone who spends a lot of time looking at reference images, and now this year trying to do more studies, it\u2019s cool to see someone else\u2019s clear lines that link what an artist is currently doing to what has come before.\\n\\n### Breakdowns\\n\\nI think I\u2019ve shared this video before but it\u2019s easily one of my favourite approaches to style studies; [Breaking Down the Hades Art Style](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHLAgvhUGs). Thom catches a lot of details and does a really cool basic sphere to show off the important style features.\\n\\n![](/img/style-studies/hades-sphere.png)  \\n   \\nAnother interesting breakdown is [Dayron Desmet\u2019 study to create a style bible](https://www.artstation.com/artwork/kDyR9x) where he goes over multiple different facets of the style before designing his own 3 accessories in the game style.\\n\\n## Style warm-ups\\n\\nI started with recreating a few smaller art assets from Hades. No full character portraits, except for Dusa who is probably the smallest portrait in the game.\\n\\nI chopped these birds off of Artemis\u2019s bow because I love them but also hardly noticed them before since they\u2019re so far away from the rest of her body. I suspect they\u2019re cropped out in most scenes when she\u2019s on the screen.\\n\\nI struggled with these guys a lot. I felt like I wasn\u2019t getting the shapes down. I hated the way the line art looked. I had no wait in the fixed sized brush. Sunday and Monday were mostly try > delete > restart. Then I finally mentally gave myself permission to not try to match the shapes as accurately and really turned up stabilisation on the brush settings.\\n\\n![](/img/style-studies/hades-practices.jpg)\\n\\nThe wallet came out okay but my drop of focus on the shape made for some uneven edges but I enjoyed the gold bits.\\n\\nDusa was more of a struggle, just being more complex than the previous two practice pieces. But I really wanted to draw the snakes so I stuck with this one even with her slightly off-tilt face.\\n\\n### Brush\\n\\nIt was during these practices that I was able to figure out the right brush because the line work is another part of the distinguished style. It\'s main feature being a lack of tapering and consistent width.\\n\\nThom, in his render breakdown video name dropped the brush he used but I don\'t have that one. I ended up using a Clip Studio default: The Milli pen.\\n\\nThis marker has no tapering, a locked size, and no pressure sensitivity turned on. So to work with smaller or larger lines I would manually change the size. Keeping my range from 7-4. 7 being used only for the external lines and then going down a number for each time I felt like I was going more \\"interior\\" to the piece.\\n\\n![](/img/style-studies/milli-pen.png)\\n\\n## Final piece\\n\\nI had already made up my mind to use Skril as my Hades adaptation character, I have a few outfits for her, so I wouldn\'t have to start from zero design wise.  What I did need was a pose. \\n\\nI tried sketching out a few options and then decided the hand forward pose was the right amount of drama. Used [this as my reference](https://ca.pinterest.com/pin/598978819231278895/).\\n\\nFollowing the workflow from the Style Breakdown video I started with the lines. I now had more confidence in the process and also the look of the lines compared to my earlier practices. One change up I did go for was to not do the hard black shadows in the first pass. Sticking to only the functional lines.\\n\\nI then moved on to flats which was a study in itself. Due to an old laptop dying I didn\u2019t have easy access to a Skril reference and instead colour picked them from a photograph of a marker piece from 5 years ago. This ended up being decently accurate. \\n\\n![](/img/style-studies/ss-hades-skril-base-colours.jpg)\\n\\nBut I had a problem, Hades portraits are colour balanced very carefully.\\n\\n### Colour breakdown\\n![](/img/style-studies/hades-colours1.jpg)\\nFrom reading and watching other people break down the style it became clear that I shouldn\u2019t have too many different saturated colours. Characters usually have one main focus colour, often their outfit, while the other large swatches of colour are more de-saturated.\\n\\n![](/img/style-studies/hades-colours2.jpg)\\n\\nI also checked the values but these didn\u2019t say much to me. If anything it only highlighted that the colour balance does a lot of work to make the characters easily readable without having any very high values (Less white and less high contrast zones than I would have thought). Or maybe the sheer amount of pure black was throwing off my evaluation.\\n\\n![](/img/style-studies/hades-colours-values.jpg)\\n\\nWith this knowledge I changed up Skril\u2019s skin, horn, and hair colour.  Leaving just the saturated reds and golds. As the red fell into a similar zone as the prime colours for Hypnos and Meg:\\n\\n![](/img/style-studies/hades-colours3.jpg)\\n\\n![](/img/style-studies/hades-skril-desat.jpg)\\n\\nWith the colours changed I spent some time choosing the shadow and terminator line colour for my main colours. The terminator line colour is one of the unique calling card features of the Hades style. The terminator line is the line of colour around the darker shadow colour. Usually it would just be a colour between the base and the shadow but in this style it\u2019s usually a colour between the two but also decently hue shifted. \\n\\nWith lines, flats, and shading done, it was time to start adding the black shadows. I don\u2019t know if it was good to leave this part for last. If only because I ended up covering multiple areas I spent time shading\u2026\\n\\n![](/img/style-studies/ss-hades-skril-shadows.jpg)\\n\\nI\u2019m still not sure if there should be more black. General art advice is to not use pure whites or pure blacks so it still feels extreme to me to have those big black areas.\\n\\nWith the piece nearly done, it was time for random sparkles. \\n\\nThis is another unique feature of the style that people have noticed. All art pieces have what appear to be random specks of teal, purple, pink, and a few other colours. I couldn\u2019t find any evidence of these colours being applied in a specific way so I kind of just put them around randomly.\\n\\n![](/img/style-studies/ss-hades-skril-done.jpg)\\n\\n## What I missed\\n\\nThere are a few places where I deviated from the official style.\\n\\nFirstly is in my smooth lines. In Hades art you\'ll almost never find a perfect circle, even perfect curves are rare. But I was drawing a curvy lady so I drew curvy lines. I also hadn\'t been able to build up line confidence in my warm-ups and I was relying a lot of brush stabalization to get lines I was happy with. Downside being that those almost come out **too** perfect.\\n\\nAnother issue, building on those curved lines was my lack of squares. A lot of Hades art has points and hard curves, also called \'Sharp Shape Language\' in Thom\'s breakdown. If you look at characters fingers you\'ll see they have square tips. This was a bit because of the lines and a bit because I forgot. Line work is what I struggle with so it takes up a lot of my attention. So while I\'m focused on just trying to get lines I like I forgot there were other rules to be following.\\n\\nFor colours I feel like I maybe didn\'t use enough? The official art has an almost busy feeling to it when you look closely. There is a lot going on. While I left some rather large basic red zones in my pieces. I probably could have tried a few ways of making it more lively.\\n\\nOh and I didn\'t draw legs. I thought the image would crop higher up for the fake screenshot so I hadn\'t bothered to give them lines and then by the end of it I didn\'t want to go back and add them back in lol. \\n\\n## \u201cIn-game\u201d screenshot\\n\\n![](/img/style-studies/hades-box-final.jpg)\\n\\nMaking fake Hades screenshots is a pretty popular artist project so finding all the pieces needed was very easy. But in case anyone ever comes looking here they are in one place.\\n\\n### Text box\\n\\nI suspect a few people have done this themselves already, but [TheeMonkeyPrince](https://www.deviantart.com/theemonkeyprince/gallery)\u2019s [version](https://www.deviantart.com/theemonkeyprince/art/Hades-Dialogue-Box-Template-859250942) comes up first in a search result. There\u2019s some clear pixelation issues found in the shape they used to hide text from the screenshot they used but that\u2019s easy to fix with a little blur. \\n\\n### Fonts\\n\\nI didn\u2019t have these ready to go when I started the text box but as I suspected someone had done the research long ago. Even named which font is used for what in this [helpful StackExchange comment](https://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/questions/163095/what-fonts-are-used-in-the-video-game-hades).\\n\\n![](/img/style-studies/hades-fonts.png)\\n\\nI\u2019ve become very fond of the font for character names which is titled [Caesar Dressing](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Caesar+Dressing).\\n\\n### Background\\n\\nFor the background, I grabbed [Joanne Tran](https://joannetran.artstation.com/)\u2019s official work [from her ArtStation page](https://joannetran.artstation.com/projects/v2401Y) where she\u2019s shared a lot of Hades art. \\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nI have given myself a stretch goal of creating a more Underdark themed background to use in my fake screenshot since that\'s where Skril\'s from. Just not sure when I\'ll have time to squeeze in an extra background.\\n\\nThis study took a few days longer than I normally allow. Fell on a D&D week and I lose my creative window on D&D days to D&D prep. And then I felt under the weather on Sunday so that was my main art days gone. So instead of my planned WAP week I\'m going to spend this week getting familiar with some tools.\\n\\nI upgraded to Clip Studio v4 last week so I\'m excited to try out some of it\'s new features. And I want to learn the new features in the ToonSquid v2 release that happened a few months ago. So maybe I\'ll try and get back into some animation stuff this week."},{"id":"yoga-poses","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/yoga-poses","source":"@site/blog/2025-03-09-yoga.md","title":"Anatomy practice - Yoga","description":"Drawing bodies in yoga poses.","date":"2025-03-09T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"art","permalink":"/blog/tags/art"}],"readingTime":2.825,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Kylie","title":"Admin","url":"https://github.com/kylies","imageURL":"https://github.com/kylies.png","key":"kylie","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Anatomy practice - Yoga","description":"Drawing bodies in yoga poses.","slug":"yoga-poses","authors":["kylie"],"tags":["art"],"image":"/img/poses/yoga-1.6.jpg"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Style Study - Hades","permalink":"/blog/hades-study"},"nextItem":{"title":"Reference Study - Fey Boat","permalink":"/blog/fey-boat"}},"content":"The last practice in the weekly rotation is classic anatomy and posing. I don\u2019t even dislike doing pose practice but doing it for a week straight is a little much and by day 4 I\u2019m tired of it. But I still want to push myself through the motions so I don\u2019t just try to keep cutting corners with it.\\n\\nI am still trying to keep these weeks on a theme to be a little more focused and also to keep getting new kinds of poses. This week is yoga, so not the most natural of poses but a good reminder in the ways bodies can bend and move. With the extra difficulty of really needing to focus on the length of limbs because they often need to land in certain places.\\n\\n\\n## Day 1 - Drawing from imagination\\n\\nDrawing what poses I can remember, which isn\u2019t very many.\\n\\n![](/img/poses/yoga-1.1.png)\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## Day 2 - Figure sketching\\n\\nDoing some quick figure studies to remember shapes better.\\n\\n![Quick hand sketches using references](/img/poses/yoga-1.2.jpg)\\n\\n## Day 3 - Reference studies\\n\\nMy current approach to the study days is to do a trace version as it really helps to figure out the limbs you can\u2019t see and then do a free hand version to try to reinforce what I got from the trace. What I want to add to my practice days is one for pushing the pose. Which wouldn\u2019t have really worked for yoga as it\u2019s already a rather extreme shape for a body to take but I think will work well for other activities.\\n\\n![](/img/poses/yoga-1.3.jpg)\\n\\n![](/img/poses/yoga-1.4.jpg)\\n\\n## Day 4 - Reference studies\\n\\n![](/img/poses/yoga-1.5.jpg)\\n\\n![](/img/poses/yoga-1.6.jpg)\\n\\n![](/img/poses/yoga-1.7.jpg)\\n\\n\\n\\n## Day 5 - Drawing from imagination\\n\\nFor the test day I wanted to try different angles instead of different poses. Since I struggled to get much beyond profile shots for yoga poses I thought it would be good to make my brain work by changing the camera angle.\\n\\nI did two basic poses first, warrior and cobra. Then I did front angles for both and then a top down, birds eye view for warrior. I think I maybe kept things too sketchy and worry these might not be readable. But since it\u2019s mostly practice on making sure body parts are in the correct place and not using this for a future piece I do want to keep things sketchy and light.\\n\\n![](/img/poses/yoga-1.8.jpg)\\n\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nSomething I struggled with this week was finding references of yoga poses not in full profile. It\u2019s just how most photography is done as it\u2019s the best way to view the pose if you want to replicate it yourself. But it made for rather static looking bodies when they\u2019re all at the exact same angle. Next anatomy theme needs to be something that\u2019s, weirdly, photographed less.\\n\\nThis anatomy week brings my first practice cycle of the year to a close. Did one; Style study, WAP, Reference study, and one anatomy week. So today the cycle starts again as I return to style studies, with this week\'s style being The Art of Hades (the video game). A fairly iconic style now, the game has a huge fandom of people replicating the style so I know I\u2019ll find Youtube videos. But there isn\u2019t as much from the studio and art director, which makes sense as you don\u2019t really want another game copying your visual style.\\n\\nPinterest board [of yoga poses.](https://ca.pinterest.com/maeanu3639/wap-yoga/)"},{"id":"fey-boat","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/fey-boat","source":"@site/blog/2025-03-02-refstudy1.md","title":"Reference Study - Fey Boat","description":"Taking 3 reference images and making them into 1.","date":"2025-03-02T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"art","permalink":"/blog/tags/art"}],"readingTime":5.89,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Kylie","title":"Admin","url":"https://github.com/kylies","imageURL":"https://github.com/kylies.png","key":"kylie","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Reference Study - Fey Boat","description":"Taking 3 reference images and making them into 1.","slug":"fey-boat","authors":["kylie"],"tags":["art"],"image":"/img/rs/rs1_tuesday.png"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Anatomy practice - Yoga","permalink":"/blog/yoga-poses"},"nextItem":{"title":"Weekly Art Practice - Week 41","permalink":"/blog/wap-41"}},"content":"As I was preparing my art practice goals for the new year I knew I wanted to practice finishing pieces more often. My WAP weeks were about expanding my mental library of images and drawing things I don\u2019t often draw. But those barely ever left the sketch phase as they were focused on getting the shapes down. The style studies are a lot of fun and I\u2019ll keep doing them but they mean working in a very focused way to achieve a rather limited goal, matching someone else\u2019s style. And while these will help me learn things that will eventually become my style, the execution won\u2019t always feel natural.\\n\\nAnd so I came up with this new exercise after watching a few \u201clearning from references\u201d art tutorial videos on YouTube. Basically the idea is that instead of just using one image as inspiration you use multiple so you\u2019re leaning less on one particular artist or style.\\n\\nLast week in my [beetles WAP](https://www.kymira.ca/blog/wap-41) I wrote about how this would go. Rolling dice to select 3 images and then go from there. So we\u2019ll start with my 3 images:\\n\\n## Reference Images\\n\\n![](/img/rs/rs1_refs.jpg)\\n\\nI was pretty excited about getting the boat first. Thought I could do some sort of Dredge inspired piece with it. The piece is by concept artist [Arthus Pilorget](https://www.artstation.com/artwork/r33nO).\\n\\nBut then I got the colour palette\u2026 which isn\u2019t very Dredge like at all. The Genshin Impact Kazuha palette was put together by [Caramello\\\\_\\\\_o over on Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/s/090280618a).\\n\\nDice roll 3 added these nature spirit guys by [dagasi_yk on Twitter](https://x.com/dagasi_yk) as the main characters. \\n\\nWanting to expand my ideas beyond just the three images so I made a mini board of things I felt were in a similar vibe. [Full board](https://ca.pinterest.com/maeanu3639/2025-num-1/).\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## Thumbnailing\\n\\nFirst step was to do some basic brainstorming. Starting with what first came to mind and then pushing the POV around to see if the scene got more interesting from other angles.\\n\\n![](/img/rs/rs1_thumbnails.jpg)\\n\\n## Basic colours and shapes\\n\\n![](/img/rs/rs1_sketch.jpg)\\n\\nI had a decent amount of time on Sunday so after choosing which thumbnail to go with I enlarged it and started to play around with the main colours. I was fairly fixated on have a big orange sky, which may have not been the best choice in the end but I found it rather pleasant to work with as it gave a quickly, otherworldly-ness, to the piece.\\n\\n## Day 1 progress\\n\\nIt\u2019s not often that I give myself a whole week to work on a single piece. During my Root style study week I made 3 complete pieces in 7 days. Having 7 days for one felt extravagant. \\n\\nOr at least it did until I started painting. I couldn\u2019t choose how I wanted to do the piece. Did I want hard black lines? Did I want lineless? A softer painting style? Or flat and blocky?\\n\\nWhile I had 3 images as references to build the piece, I didn\u2019t use any of them to really dictate the style. So I pulled up some digital painting videos and waited for inspiration to reach me. Eventually, I got my first piece down; the roof.\\n\\n![](/img/rs/rs1_sunday1.png)\\n\\nI was pretty happy with how these shingles looked but my attempt to make it more readable by changing the colours instantly broke my colour palette and also made the scene look like it was made out of candy. But I already felt myself floundering so I pushed on. Grabbing the part of the image that interested me most, the little guys.\\n\\n![](/img/rs/rs1_sunday2.png)\\n\\nThese guys I was happy with. With these guys I could end my day not hating the piece.\\n\\n## Work continues\\n\\nWith the weekend done I made it a goal to try to put 1 hour into the piece everyday after work. Some days saw more progress than others. By Tuesday I had most of a boat.\\n\\n![](/img/rs/rs1_tuesday.png)\\n\\nAfter that I kind of stopped saving progress shots\u2026.\\n\\nI finished most of the boat before going to the background. I returned to my struggles of choosing a stylistic choice once more and you can see me growing impatient by turning to leaf brushes for the tree and grass brushes to fill in the small islands. I\u2019m not against using these kinds of brushes but since I only use them for these 2 features and they\u2019re off to the side on their own island it does make them stand out more by not being consistent with the rest of the piece. If I had thought ahead and maybe balanced the islands in the background differently I could probably have made it look more normalized. But I\u2019m kind of a \u201cjust push through\u201d kind of artist. A habit I\u2019m going to try to fix.\\n\\n## Final piece\\n\\nI was able to wrap up the whole thing on Saturday, rushing to get it done before running D&D and having taken the morning off to make a map and draw some goblins for the game.\\n\\n![](/img/rs/rs1_final.jpg)\\n\\nOverall I think about somewhere between 10-15 hours went into this piece. Being able to take my time led to some parts I\u2019m really happy with, like some of the wood texturing on the boat, how textured the clouds look, the little plant guys. There are definitely some areas I rushed either because I didn\u2019t know how to accomplish what I wanted or because I was losing interest. I think next time I do this challenge I\u2019m going to try to give myself a Friday deadline so I can spend a whole Saturday just working on light and shadows and colour corrections because that\u2019s something I really enjoy but rarely give myself enough time to do properly.\\n\\nI\u2019m not sure how well I was able to stick to the palette. I probably wouldn\u2019t have chosen these colours on my own so it was nice to have the restriction, but it also made me constantly worry about deviating too far when wanting to do some hue shifted shadows. I also didn\'t keep some of the main points I highlighted in my thumbnails. I didn\'t keep the side wheel which I really wanted, or have there be plants on the boat. It just felt like I had enough going on when I made the choices but I kind of regret it now.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nWhile I could talk about all the cut corners and the things I\u2019m not particularly pleased with, this was a very big project for me and it makes me happy when I look at it. I do wish I had played with more foreground/background stuff but this was my first project in this practice format so plenty of time to take more chances in the future. Maybe I\u2019ll even enforce the palette further by not allowing any shifts and having to use only the chosen colours as highlights and shadows. Lots of options for the next one!\\n\\nNext week I\u2019m going back to anatomy studies as it\u2019s another facet I want to keep improving at and the secret to that one is basically just keep doing it."},{"id":"wap-41","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/wap-41","source":"@site/blog/2025-02-23-week41.md","title":"Weekly Art Practice - Week 41","description":"Week 41 - Beetles","date":"2025-02-23T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"art","permalink":"/blog/tags/art"},{"inline":true,"label":"wap","permalink":"/blog/tags/wap"}],"readingTime":3.175,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Kylie","title":"Admin","url":"https://github.com/kylies","imageURL":"https://github.com/kylies.png","key":"kylie","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Weekly Art Practice - Week 41","description":"Week 41 - Beetles","slug":"wap-41","authors":["kylie"],"tags":["art","wap"],"image":"/img/wap/wap-41.5.jpg"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Reference Study - Fey Boat","permalink":"/blog/fey-boat"},"nextItem":{"title":"Style Study - Kyle Ferrin","permalink":"/blog/kyle-ferrin-study"}},"content":"First WAP of 2025! \\n\\nI\u2019m keeping some WAPs in the mix with my other practice things this year to give me some easier weeks and also to keep drawing things I don\u2019t usually draw. It\u2019s nice to return to a practice format that\u2019s familiar and feels doable. Versus some of the larger challenges I\u2019m also trying to give myself this year.\\n\\nThis first WAP is beetles, so I guess stop reading now if you don\u2019t like looking at bugs as there will be zoomed in pictures of bugs.\\n\\n## Day 1 - Drawing from imagination\\n\\nBeetles aren\u2019t too complex right? I can just draw some from the ether.\\n\\n![](/img/wap/wap-41.1.jpg)\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## Day 2 - Figure sketching\\n\\nThere are a lot of hercules and rhinoceros beetles on Pinterest so that\u2019s what I ended up focusing on. I didn\u2019t know how large these bugs were until this week and boy, I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m better off knowing or not. \\n\\n![Quick hand sketches using references](/img/wap/wap-41.2.jpg)\\n\\n## Day 3 - Reference studies\\n\\nSome of the biggest things I missed in my initial sketches were how complex beetle legs are. They are very spiky and have a decent amount of joints. I also missed that some have some antenna things going on but you need a very good photo to see them.\\n\\n![](/img/wap/wap-41.3.1.jpg)\\n\\n![](/img/wap/wap-41.3.2.jpg)\\n\\n## Day 4 - Style studies\\n\\nThere are some really nice stylized beetles out there. And it was nice to see how much people simplified the complicated limbs.\\n\\n![](/img/wap/wap-41.4.1.jpg)\\n\\nReference: Pinterest says this is by [opossum_jesus on Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/opossum_jesus/) but their account is private so I can\u2019t verify. There is also a Redbubble account selling a sticker version but it\u2019s been taken down. So whoever drew this has been taking down their art from public spaces.\\n\\n![](/img/wap/wap-41.4.2.jpg)\\n\\nI didn\u2019t do the really pretty pattern as it wasn\u2019t going to contribute to grasping the shape of a beetle but i do really love this piece by Oddarette.\\n\\nReference: [By Oddarette on Cara](https://cara.app/post/e8dafedc-1170-4eb4-94ad-fa3311ad83cc)\\n\\n![](/img/wap/wap-41.4.3.jpg)\\n\\nReference: A vector image from[Freepik]https://www.freepik.com/premium-vector/beetle-illustration-cartoon-character-drawing_69868105.htm)\\n\\n## Day 5 - Drawing from imagination\\n\\nFor test day I drew some basic guys but then also wanted to do a slightly more cartoon-y character. Hence the warrior beetle holding a staff in the corner.\\n\\n![](/img/wap/wap-41.5.jpg)\\n\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nInsects definitely aren\u2019t something I draw regularly, nor are they something I often want to look very closely at. But I think it\u2019s important to draw them, and at least understand how to draw them as they are everywhere and looking at them so closely helps to demystify them. Makes me squirm a little less at each new photo.\\n\\nIt was nice to return to the WAP format, I feel like I can get through the daily task fairly quickly now. Made for a good practice exercise for a week where I was still feeling pretty ill and low energy. This coming week I\u2019m trying something a little more intensive, doing an exercise to help learn how to draw from reference.\\n\\nI created 3 pin boards:\\n- Colour schemes\\n- Locations\\n- Characters\\n\\nThen for each one of those boards I rolled a di so I would randomly get a colour scheme to use for a type of location which will feature a random character. Forcing me to get creative in how all three pieces fit together and create something new. I want these to be fully rendered pieces and I have the sketch for my first one completed already but I\u2019m struggling with how to colour it. Do I want to try a digital painting style? Do I stick with my default black linework? Should I try to bring in some of the techniques I learned from my Root study week?????? Just so many options and none of them are working for me just yet.\\n\\nPinterest board [of beetles](https://ca.pinterest.com/maeanu3639/wap-beetles/)."},{"id":"kyle-ferrin-study","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/kyle-ferrin-study","source":"@site/blog/2025-02-09-kf-study.md","title":"Style Study - Kyle Ferrin","description":"A week spent studying the art style of the board game Root, as done by Kyle Ferrin.","date":"2025-02-09T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"art","permalink":"/blog/tags/art"},{"inline":true,"label":"style study","permalink":"/blog/tags/style-study"}],"readingTime":8.345,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Kylie","title":"Admin","url":"https://github.com/kylies","imageURL":"https://github.com/kylies.png","key":"kylie","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Style Study - Kyle Ferrin","description":"A week spent studying the art style of the board game Root, as done by Kyle Ferrin.","slug":"kyle-ferrin-study","authors":["kylie"],"tags":["art","style study"],"image":"/img/style-studies/kf-full-scene1.jpg"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Weekly Art Practice - Week 41","permalink":"/blog/wap-41"},"nextItem":{"title":"Devlog - SWAK Week 4","permalink":"/blog/swak-4"}},"content":"As part of my WAP year I did one style study, [Ken Sugimori\u2019s Pokemon trainers](https://www.kymira.ca/blog/wap-34). This year I\u2019m going to attempt to do a style study every month to push me out of my comfort zone and also to learn to break down what I\u2019m looking at when it comes to art pieces.\\n\\nKyle Ferrin was an easy first choice as he has both a very distinct style that\u2019s almost instantly recognizable to me and it\u2019s extremely cute. For this study I\u2019m focusing mostly on his visual style of the boardgame Root and not his whole portfolio but he is pretty consistent in some regards.\\n\\nBefore jumping in I wanted to identify the main things I wanted to learn or understand in this particular study:\\n\\n- Ink work: Kyle uses blank ink for a lot of shadows, much more than I would usually  \\n- Shapes: We\u2019re gonna be looking at a lot of little critters, how does he keep them recognizable?  \\n- Colours: The work in Root feels extremely vibrant while still natural.  \\n- Backgrounds: Kyle doesn\u2019t do a lot of backgrounds but does have a few techniques he repeats.\\n\\nStudies are going to break down differently from my WAP weeks, and may even differ from artist to artist. I made a 5 day plan for this one and mostly managed to stick to it.\\n\\n## Day 1 - Research and techniques\\n\\nRoot and Kyle are, thankfully, both very popular. An added bonus is that Kyle has some recorded streams of his full art process. This makes understanding his workflow pretty easy as you can watch him do it in real time. I was even able to find 2 interviews he did where he talks about art which led to a few gems that helped me approach this study week.\\n\\nInterview 1: [Kyle Ferrin: Art in Board Games #31](https://www.moregamesplease.com/art-in-boardgames/2018/3/15/kyle-ferrin-art-in-board-games-31)\\n\\nInterview 2: [Interview with Kyle Ferrin, Artist on Root!](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/bu8a6l/interview_with_kyle_ferrin_artist_on_root/?rdt=54583) (Original website seems broken)\\n\\nIt was in the images chosen for the More Games Please interview that I noticed the bush and tree techniques. So on day one I tried to recreate those techniques digitally. I then took my old goblin drawing and did an inking pass on it to practice where Kyle would put harder shadows, using this collection of skeleton warriors as examples to reference.\\n\\n![](/img/style-studies/kf_techniques1.jpg)\\n\\nI then spent some time with the Root cover image and a collection of Kyle goblins. I love how expressive his characters are and I wanted to look more closely at Root character proportions.\\n\\n![](/img/style-studies/kf-faces.jpg)\\n\\n## Day 2 - First attempt at the style\\n\\nFeeling pretty excited by what I learned in day 1 I jumped into creating a Root fanart piece. I wanted to draw critters that aren\u2019t as common in Root so I chose pigeon and squirrel. Kyle has done a few squirrels but I have to say they aren\u2019t my favourite designs of his.\\n\\n![](/img/style-studies/kf-full-scene1.jpg)\\n\\nI\u2019m happy with a lot of this piece but there are a few areas that stand out for improvement. Mostly the building. There aren\u2019t many full buildings in the Root art so I didn\u2019t have much to use as a reference. Because of that I kind of just floundered and used it to fill space. I also could have played with more line/ink colour variations instead of just black and white.\\n\\n## Day 3 - Workflow replication\\n\\nTo see Kyle\u2019s workflow in action I watched his live stream from three months ago: [Leder Games | Art Stream with Kyle Ferrin!](https://youtu.be/kxlhol6JOhQ?si=ua68nO0f4xz1k0sk)\\n\\nWhich seems to breakdown to:\\n1. Sketch  \\n2. Ink  \\n3. Scan  \\n4. Digital colours\\n\\nSo I would do the same. Instead of adding difficulty of coming up with a piece from scratch I decided to recreate a piece of Root art. I wanted something with a little bit of background as well as a character so I went with this raccoon behind a log piece.\\n\\n![Raccoon in behind a log by Kyle Ferrin](/img/style-studies/kyle-forest-raccoon.jpg)\\n(This is an original Root piece.)\\n\\nI did a sketch and then tested my pens because it\u2019s been a long time since I inked anything by hand. Most of what I own are Microns which didn\u2019t feel right for this, they are too small and precise. So I chose my pens that had more of a brush tip for larger areas.\\n\\n![](/img/style-studies/raccoon-inks.jpg)\\n\\nI don\u2019t have a scanner so I had to rely on trying to get a good phone photo. It came out pretty decent after some level corrections in CSP but also felt like there were a lot of strange artifacts like red pixels and blurring in the photo.\\n\\nI then colour picked from the original and tried out some digital watercolour brushes to get that textured look that Kyle gets. In the video Kyle shares the limited Root colour palette that he uses for all the board game pieces. And in one of the interviews he said:\\n\\n\u201cMost of the color pallet for the board art in Root is sampled from autumn foliage photography.\u201d \\n\\nSo I also felt comfortable deviating a little from the source image as long as I kept the autumn colours in mind.\\n\\n![](/img/style-studies/kf-copy-study.jpg)\\n\\nMy own raccoon came out a little too small but I\u2019m happy with the piece overall. I liked working with the water colour brushes as they keep the large colour areas interesting without even doing a shading pass. I did try taking some notes on areas of improvement.\\n\\n![](/img/style-studies/kf-copy-study-notes.jpg)\\n\\nYou can see them side by side here:\\n\\n![](/img/style-studies/kf-sidebyside.jpg)\\n\\n\\n## Day 4 - Watercolours\\n\\nFor day 4 I took it easy a bit by doing a physical watercolour pass on the inks I did previously. Mostly because I enjoy working with watercolours even if I\u2019m not very skilled at them. Unfortunately my pens weren\u2019t waterproof\u2026\\n\\n![](/img/style-studies/raccoon-watercolour.jpg)\\n\\nParts of it went okay while others got out of control rather quickly. But it was fun to do it physically after already doing the piece digitally.\\n\\n## Day 5 - New unique piece in the style\\n\\nFor the last day I wanted to draw something new again. I did some thumbnailing and chose the parts of the style I definitely wanted to incorporate.\\n\\nWhile most of the art for Root is small cards and mostly individual character pieces, I\u2019ve been in full \u201cscene\u201d mode from working on the visual novel. So a background and multiple characters. Basically gave myself hard mode for the final. But I really enjoyed the ways of doing forest plants, I wanted to keep doing those. \\n\\nI also didn\u2019t let myself colour pick from an image and instead eye balled the colours to see how far off I would be. I don\u2019t think any of the Root pieces do much foreground background stuff but I did darker a whole section to create some depth to the image. Trying to push the style a bit and also just bring in my own techniques for creating a scene.\\n\\n![](/img/style-studies/kf-final.jpg)\\n\\nI\u2019m pretty happy with the piece! Something I learned while working on it, while watching another Root art stream, was that Kyle works at very small sizes. He showed off the pens he used and it made me realize I\u2019ve just been super over sizing everything. When I went to use my own pens my thoughts were \u201cthese are too small\u201d when it turns out they were way too big. I didn\u2019t imagine that he was working at such a small scale, but it makes filling in blacks so much easier when you are fighting to fill a whole page. Due to working at a larger size I also end up with a lot of empty space. Most of the Root pieces don\'t have much sky and I probably shouldn\'t have filled in more of the background with larger grasses and more trees.\\n\\nSomething learned from the interviews is that the colour palette and line work style for Root is chosen with a reason; communicating game state. The art pieces are meant to be easy to parse and understand at a glance thanks to high contrast, be that between lines, colours, or shapes. Something that I went against by darkening the foreground. I have the freedom of not drawing this fanart for a game but it\'s extremely interesting to learn why certain creative desicions are made for particular settings.\\n\\n## Resources\\n\\nI\u2019m not the only person doing Kyle Ferrin or Root studies. I found one video on YouTube of another artist doing their best to replicate the style: \\n\\n<iframe width=\\"560\\" height=\\"315\\" src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/pfXEM3C8RZE?si=Qq0wve34b3kHabhh\\" title=\\"YouTube video player\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\\" referrerpolicy=\\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\\n\\nThe artist goes for a full digital approach which is what I did in my first attempt as well. I think it\u2019s okay for a single character but the larger Root scenes with backgrounds and heavier inking feel like they really need a physical ink brush to capture the style properly.\\n\\nI also found another person\u2019s Root fanart over on Reddit that I really liked: [I tried to recreate the Root artstyle!](https://www.reddit.com/r/rootgame/comments/11kssrz/i_tried_to_recreate_the_root_artstyle_free_to_use/). Their work also feels fully digital but I wasn\u2019t able to find any active website or socials for them.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nI feel like this was a very promising first style study. I\u2019m happy with the pieces I produced for it and there are tricks here that I can see myself relying on to create more stylized backgrounds. It was a fun kind of investigation to really watch someone work and try to analyses their pieces. I\u2019d also like to be able to draw my own lovable little guys but I think I still have more practice in that area to do. Downside to this study, I now want to buy all the Root games...\\n\\nFind Kyle\u2019s work at:\\n- [His Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/d20plusmodifier/)  \\n- [His store](https://kyleferrin.threadless.com/) \\n- Check out other games Kyle has worked on at [Leder Games](https://ledergames.com/).\\n\\nI\u2019ve been very sick all this week so I might take it easy next week with a more classic WAP or even a week of focusing on some Littos bits and pieces."},{"id":"swak-4","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/swak-4","source":"@site/blog/2025-01-29-swak4.md","title":"Devlog - SWAK Week 4","description":"Going into the final week, I\u2019ve done my (very likely) final pull request for art assets.

This ended up launching a quick Clip Asset Store search, buying the CPS version update (I\u2019ve been on v2.0 for years\u2026) and hoping that nothing would break in the update.\\n\\nIt thankfully all went very smoothly and I got new Clip features to use out of it! And I drew I kitchen x_x Which I won\u2019t share yet as it\u2019s only for those who choose a specific ending.\\n\\nIt feels like we actually ended up with a lot of backgrounds for a game designed around lockdown. Helps that most of the characters live in the same building so I could keep the interior scenes consistent and reuse bits and pieces. As shown in this angled hallway shot that ties in with last week\u2019s doorway shot. Didn\u2019t think I\u2019d be re-creating the wallpaper again and definitely had to re-learn the sequence of effects on it\u2026\\n\\n![](/img/swak/apt_hallway.png)\\n\\nBut it also just became difficult to have emotional character scenes without giving the characters somewhere to go. And new backgrounds feel like game progression in this kind of game. Getting to see someone else\u2019s apartment is both game progress and character relationship progress.\\n\\n## Assets\\n\\nSomething I did in the last few days was do a shading pass on our 4 characters. I wasn\u2019t sure I was going to have time when we started but I\u2019m super happy it\u2019s something I did in the end as it makes them fit into the scenes much better. The backgrounds all have shading so they look like part of the world by having their own shading.\\n\\n![](/img/swak/lauren-with-shading.jpg)\\n\\nI also darkened Lauren\u2019s skin tone to differentiate her more from Kim and show her wood nymph heritage.\\n\\nShading all the characters took about 2 days as I had to do each base differently and then jackets on top of bases. \\n\\nI made an asset spread of all the Lauren pieces to show how few assets it takes to make what I feel like is a pretty expressive character.\\n\\n![](/img/swak/lauren-spread.jpg)\\n\\nWhen I was first brainstorming how to do the characters I had mentally mapped it as \u201cdraw a happy face\u201d \u201cdraw a sad face\u201d thinking that each expression would require a face. But after some VN research it was decided that the more efficient but more programmatically demanding way to do expressions was by working with multiple assets at once. So instead of a fully drawn happy face asset, a happy face was made out of: a smile + neutral eyes. While an angry face would be made out of: a frown + squinting eyes + angled brows. And then an embarrassed face could be: a frown + blush. Basically letting us remix different eye + mouth assets to create a lot more expressions than having to draw an individual face for each expression. I feel like this really worked out for us as whenever I play the game I\u2019m tickled by how much the characters move from sentence to sentence (which is largely to do with my wife\u2019s programming timing of them all).\\n\\n## Next steps\\n\\nIt\u2019s nearly time to package and upload the game to Itch! Some final fixes are going in and stress tested over the next 24 hours. Some issues are bound to have slipped through, it\u2019s difficult to test every permutation of choices a player can make while going through the 2 days. So if you\u2019re reading this and playing the game let us know if you see anything weird.\\n\\nFor me, next week is February so I\u2019m back to smaller, weekly projects for art practice. With my first one being a style study of Kyle Ferrin, the board game artist of [Root fame](https://ledergames.com/products/root-a-game-of-woodland-might-and-right). I also want to take some time next week and review all the assets I relied on for the game and share some of my favourites in their own blog post.\\n\\nFor LitToS, we\u2019re probably going to take some time away from it and start looking for ways to make it a more sustainable project while lightly polishing what we have so far."},{"id":"swak-3","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/swak-3","source":"@site/blog/2025-01-21-swak3.md","title":"Devlog - SWAK Week 3","description":"It\u2019s time for the week 3 summary.

They were so intense for me that I felt so much relief when I opened a new canvas and could just bask in the emptiness of it. Managed a smaller, more abstract background for Day 2 in just a day, which felt nice and productive. After that I started to work on \u201cend scenes\u201d for the game. Visual novels often end on a unique art scene so we wanted some of those. Like the \u201creward\u201d for finishing the game. \\n\\nI was able to finish up one of the ending images pretty quickly and it\u2019s one of the cutest things I\u2019ve ever drawn. I want to post it online real bad but it\u2019s basically a spoiler that I want people to first see in game. So in game it will stay for a few months.\\n\\nThis background doesn\u2019t have any spoilers so check out this good wall. The door even opens! I was able to get this done pretty quickly as well thanks to some wood panelling assets and a wallpaper material from the Clip Store. It\u2019s simple but I feel like it really sells the scene in engine.\\n\\n![](/img/swak/apt-hallway.png)\\n\\n## Assets\\n\\nSince I spent so much time populating a nerd room I ended up drawing a lot of Stuff to fill the room. Tried to give it a fair bit of character. This is my collection of Little Guys for Cass\u2019s room.\\n\\n![](/img/swak/little-guys-swak.jpg)\\n\\n## Making a Montreal-like\\n\\nThe city in our game isn\u2019t Montreal, but it\u2019s got parts of Montreal with twists. It made sense to us to set the game in a city like Montreal since it\u2019s where we live and we knew we could look around and find references easily. There are some clear Montreal landmarks that I used as reference for a few backgrounds so far.\\n\\n![](/img/swak/parc_vs_park.jpg)\\n\\nThis photo is my main inspiration for the park background. The statue changed into the amethyst obelisk and the cross on the mountain replaced by our magical school.\\n\\n![](/img/swak/outside-apartments.png)\\n\\nThe apartment front is based off of an apartment building where a friend lives.\\n\\nThe school in the game is called Crowstone and I used [Montreal\u2019s Ravenscrag manor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravenscrag,_Montreal) as inspiration. This manor turned psychiatric hospital (with an honestly very dark history that the Wiki page weirdly doesn\u2019t mention) is a building near Mont Royal park but in the game I put it right on top of the hill to loom over the city. Making it visible in a few different backgrounds.\\n\\n![](/img/swak/ravenscrag.png)\\n\\nThe street scene is also very Montreal, I would have loved to include the classic spiral staircases but I would have hated doing those in perspective. Also debated having a French stop sign but we decided against it since we don\u2019t have any French in the game. And it is meant to be more of a fantasy world than the real world.\\n\\n![](/img/swak/street-day.png)\\n\\nThere are a few other iconic Montreal features like churches everywhere, constant construction, random art installation, and great parks that I\u2019d like to include in future backgrounds. Given the strong D&D influence in our game world, churches would probably become temples to different gods, construction might be magic that works on its own. But each background takes me at least 2-4 days so we\u2019ve really tried to limit our location in this first part of the game so these things won\u2019t come up in the next version. But I\u2019ll definitely be using more image inspiration like with the statue and hill photo reference because I\u2019ve really enjoyed incorporating my everyday world into a fantasy story world.\\n\\n## Next steps\\n\\nI\u2019m trying to wrap up the last art assets in the next 7 days so that we have a comfortable few days to implement everything and make sure it works before submitting the game to the jam. I\u2019m feeling pretty confident about getting through the last needed art pieces but there\u2019s still a lot of writing and other implementations to get done too.\\n\\nSomething I\u2019m noticing for myself is that by spending so much time in the Creative Zone I find myself coming up with new ideas constantly. Not just art ideas but my other hobbies too. I want to do some video editing and make a trailer for the game. I have an idea for a level 1 intro adventure in D&D. I want to work on my volunteer projects. I want to do art for the D&D campaign I\u2019m already running. And I recognize this feeling from my years doing NaNoWriMo. Part of it is longing for the thrill of a new project after being so intensely focused on a single one. Part of it is just that creative activity feeds creative energy. I\u2019d love to say that I hope to carry this energy into February but there\u2019s a solid chance I\u2019ll crash and not want to touch my tablet for a while. I\u2019ve started to get some back pain over the last few days so I\u2019d like to give myself some rest time. So resting is my main plan for February 2nd, that and getting back into physio exercises.\\n\\nYou can still play Day 1 on our [Itch.io page](https://sophiefromhowls.itch.io/love-in-the-time-of-spellphage-01) for another week or so.

Also designed this logo for an in-world restaurant:\\n\\n![](/img/swak/takeout.png)\\n\\nDrew a hand and a portal, multiple little cats. I really like doing these small one offs as I feel like I can experiment with them versus backgrounds which are way more demanding mentally. But since most of the small assets are done it\u2019s been a pretty big week for background work.\\n\\n## Backgrounds\\n\\nI had a pretty terrible time with this street scene I worked on for 4 days. \\n\\n![](/img/swak/street-day.png)\\n\\nI\u2019m going to point out all the things wrong with it but I ask that you wipe the mistakes from your brain when you play the game.\\n\\nI started fairly confidently, really loved the back line of buildings and managed to keep it mostly flat rectangles. Then I moved on to the right side of the street. Activated the perspective ruler and started to draw some buildings. It was decided that the eye line was too high and I told myself I would push all the lines down with the Transform tool once I had them done. But then I came back the next day and pushed them down and altered the perspective ruler and then started the left side. I didn\u2019t realize how much I had altered the ruler by the time I was done with the lines on the left side. I kept returning to the right side, trying to push it down more, trying to fix the roof which I drew in after the shift because the top of the buildings didn\u2019t exist in the first pass. \\n\\n![](/img/swak/street-perspective-lines.png)\\n\\nSomething I had gotten good at for the first few days was Deleting My Art. A very common and helpful art tip. Didn\u2019t like how a character was looking? Delete it. All the lines look bad? Delete them. There is learning to be taken from sticking with something incorrect and figuring out how to fix it, but I was mostly in ideation and discovery mode, so each deletion led to something better. \\n\\nBut as I feared with starting background, I fell into sunk cost fallacy and wasn\u2019t willing to throw away 2 hours of work. The saving grace of the piece is that I am really happy with the left side buildings and the back row. It feels Montreal-esque without being too on the nose. And while I\u2019m still struggling with colour selection in big pieces I don\u2019t think there are too many mistakes.\\n\\nI brought my fear into the next background I started and spent a lot of time in layout and perspective mode.\\n\\n![](/img/swak/lauren-room-measurements.png)\\n\\nI am very happy with how main character Lauren\u2019s room turned out. It doesn\u2019t feel great to instantly jump into working on another character\'s bedroom but I\u2019m hoping I can take what I learned from Lauren\u2019s room and move a little faster. Lauren\u2019s room took about 10 hours\u2026 I ended up downloading a lot of 3D objects from the Clip Studio Asset store which let me feel like I was playing with toys as I chose where to place them and size them.\\n\\nI have 2-3 backgrounds to go, even if they all take 3 days each, which leaves me some wiggle room to revisit art pieces from earlier in the month and adding more details.\\n\\n## Version 0.1 launch\\n\\nWhile conceptualizing our game we designed it around 7 days that the player would play through. When making a branching game, a solid rule is to build your Golden Path first. This can be your \u201chappy\u201d ending path, or the path you think most players will enjoy or gravitate towards. \\n\\nSince our game is a romance sim it would mean choosing one of the love interests and completing their path before anyone else\'s. This proved difficult in a pretty big way in that one of the central parts of a romance sim is being able to choose who you romance. We worried that having one obviously foregrounded character would give the wrong vibe. \\n\\nI kept pushing for finding a Golden Path during the build up week before the game as I\u2019m familiar with watching new game makers spiral out of scope and get lost in the weeds. We talked it over multiple times, thinking about how the game breaks up in other ways. Just a day or two before the jam started we had the realization that if we wanted something that felt like a full game, we could scope by days instead of paths. We scoped down pretty drastically, to the first 2 days of the story. The major downside being that this scoping didn\u2019t help with scoping down of asset requirements as we would still need art for each character and location.\\n\\nAnd while this did mean rushing through as much art as possible in the first few days, I think this scope is what\u2019s to credit for us being able to publish Day 1 as version 0.1 before the end of week two.\\n\\n![](/img/swak/littos-itch.png)\\n\\nYou can play Day 1 on our [Itch.io page](https://sophiefromhowls.itch.io/love-in-the-time-of-spellphage-01) however I do recommend downloading a version instead of playing in the browser as you\u2019ll have a better audio and performance experience that way. We\u2019ve gotten some positive feedback from friends already and possibly some Beta Tester who are strangers to us and have fewer reasons to be nice to us :o\\n\\n## Next steps\\n\\nThe next big thing for the project is writing Day 2. We have some ideas on these scenes but it will likely be a fair bit of brainstorming still. For myself, I\u2019ll likely be in background mode for the next week as we don\u2019t even know all the scenes or locations we\u2019ll need for Day 2 yet...\\n\\nWe\u2019re also hoping to get feedback during week 3 and incorporate anything actionable before the end of the month.\\n\\nIt\u2019s likely to be another focused week and I already feel myself longing to do art that doesn\u2019t involve a perspective ruler. But feeling very accomplished in what we\'ve been able to make so far!"},{"id":"swak-1","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/swak-1","source":"@site/blog/2025-01-08-swak1.md","title":"Devlog - SWAK Week 1","description":"New year new projects, starting with the Sealed With a Kiss game jam.

Which has led to creating more art in a few days than any period last year. \\n\\n![](/img/swak/asset_tracking.png)\\n\\nThe speed won\u2019t last though. I got through most of the character art but now I\u2019m mostly left with backgrounds and I probably won\u2019t be able to get through more than one of those every few days. So far 5-8 hours seems like the average time they requires. But we\u2019ll see how the next week goes, for now, it\u2019s recap time.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## Asset creation\\n\\nWe had the basics of our game flow and story figured out before we started so I was able to get a pretty solid list of \u201cto-do\u201d work ready before day one. Characters were the priority as they take more than just drawing time but also programming time. So if I could get the characters done quickly it would give my wife more time to work with them in Ren\u2019py.\\n\\nI was able to get basic sketches down for each of the 4 main characters on day one which felt like an accomplishment and was already faster than I had planned for.\\n\\n![](/img/swak/character_sketches.png)\\n\\nAside from characters and backgrounds we also had some smaller assets that were needed. A wand for our energy mechanic, a large book for light novel scenes. It\u2019s unlikely that we\u2019ve reached the end of assets and new ones will continue to arise over the next few weeks. The asset tracker Total has already increased since I took that screenshot...\\n\\n## Characters\\n\\nAfter the first sketches I let the characters sit for a day before returning to them. Art Director Wife wanted our main character to look a little more \\"student struggling\\" so I spent time revisiting her. Other characters had smaller fixes up I worked on during second passes. 7 days in and I think we have most of the final details for our cast.\\n\\n![](/img/swak/character_flats.png)\\n\\nTheir designs are a mix of D&D inspo meets Montreal in the 80s. I spent a fair bit of time scrolling through 80s fashion and trying to find a unique look for each of them. But then I remembered we set the story in December so everyone needs a jacket layer for being outside :| The scope just keeps growing. \\n\\n## Backgrounds\\n\\nI haven\u2019t done too much work on backgrounds yet but I have made the promising discovery of the default Pointillism brush in CSP. We had envisioned a slightly more abstract or impressionistic backgrounds and I wasn\u2019t sure how to approach this. I spent a decent amount of time just testing brushes to find something pleasing to work with and look at. It\u2019s worked for the one background that has a lot of plants and snow, now I\u2019ll just hope it can hold up in backgrounds that have more buildings.\\n\\n![](/img/swak/ao_day.png)\\n\\nIndoor scenes will be another whole thing. I don\u2019t think pointillism will work as well there so I expect a decent amount of trial and error. So far I only have this computer background which still needs a fair bit of work but I wanted to get it in early since it\u2019s a big part of the game.\\n\\n![](/img/swak/computer_background.png)\\n\\nAn additional added goal to backgrounds is having a day and night version of each scene. Ren\u2019py has some shaders which can be applied to backgrounds and images on top of backgrounds which give a lot of options. But for outdoor scenes I\u2019m going to try to do 2 versions of each:\\n\\n![](/img/swak/ao_park_both.png)\\n\\nAlso, a huge shout out to the Clip Studio Asset store. Everyone sharing assets is saving me hours of work, just some great stuff in there.\\n\\n## The game so far\\n\\nWhile I\u2019ve been fully focused on art assets my wife has been tackling everything else about the game. Launch screen, writing, sound effects, menus, energy mechanic, multiple text areas, music, assigning assets. Basically just everything.\\n\\n![](/img/swak/launch_screen.png)\\n\\nAs of today, the 8th, we\u2019re almost done with day 1 of gameplay/story. This means written scenes and mechanics. There are still some missing key backgrounds, like our main character\'s room. We have some placeholder graphics in there currently for those. Once we have day 1 story all in place we\u2019ll start sharing the game with some folks and try to get some feedback in hopes of actioning it before we get too far into day 2!\\n\\n![](/img/swak/day-1-activities.png)"},{"id":"wap-up","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/wap-up","source":"@site/blog/2024-12-30-wapup.md","title":"WAP Up","description":"A year in review of my weekly art practice","date":"2024-12-30T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"art","permalink":"/blog/tags/art"}],"readingTime":6.605,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Kylie","title":"Admin","url":"https://github.com/kylies","imageURL":"https://github.com/kylies.png","key":"kylie","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"WAP Up","description":"A year in review of my weekly art practice","slug":"wap-up","authors":["kylie"],"tags":["art"],"image":"/img/wap/cara_2024.png"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Devlog - SWAK Week 1","permalink":"/blog/swak-1"},"nextItem":{"title":"Books - 2024 review","permalink":"/blog/books-2024"}},"content":"When I first launched into this goal of practicing art in a focused fashion every week I wasn\u2019t sure I\u2019d be able to maintain it. I also wasn\u2019t sure if it was going to be a practice that would lead to noticeable improvements. Just drawing every day isn\u2019t enough to keep getting better, so I was really relying on the focused methodology of practice flow to pay off.\\n\\nGiven my last 2 weeks of revisits, my new found near comfort drawing hands, and lack of fear of the blank page, I feel like it has. I did end up drawing mostly animals as a comfort zone, but then expanded my focus halfway through the year to include anatomy weeks to make sure I was still continuing to work on the fundamentals. Then in the last few months I tried to add the goal of completing a finished piece once a month as well.

For week 4\u2019s Hands I ended up using those hands in an [Altar Stone video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBSK7HGX5Nc). The Goblin from week 6 has been turned into an animated gif, [critiqued on a Drawclass](https://www.youtube.com/live/lpQ1jxd11gk?si=6_Cmi73tp87CkN_3&t=6860), and animated in Godot. I used the Me piece on the About page on this website. After doing a Pokemon trainer of myself I also [made one of my wife](https://bsky.app/profile/kymira.ca/post/3lbwsojqvw223).\\n\\nI think practicing can feel like it\u2019s \u201cgoing nowhere\u201d when you don\u2019t have finished pieces you\u2019re proud of. If I look through my blog posts it does just feel like a bunch of messy sketches and those don\u2019t have \u201ca use\u201d. But this is from productivity brainrot of everything you do needs to lead to something or produce something and a big part of taking on a creative project for me was to get away from that mindset. In 2023 when I spent the year doing 21 Draw classes I felt like I didn\u2019t have much to show for all the class time I put in. This year I have physical sketchbooks and multiple iPads filled with everything I\u2019ve been doing. But I still want more \u201cfinished\u201d pieces not so much to have something to show for my time but because there\u2019s only parts of art that you get to after the sketch phase. And this year has been a lot of the sketch phase.\\n\\nIt\u2019s easy to forget that I was also making animated backgrounds for Altar Stone for 10 months of the year. And working on some side pieces that I just felt inspired to do.\\n\\n![](/img/artwork/ikto-elden.png)\\n\\n## Courses\\n\\nWhile 2023 had been about trying to take as many 21 Draw courses as I could, I didn\u2019t focus on courses this year. I\u2019m at the Drawclass level of the Drawfee Patreon which means one, 2 hour course every month which has been a nice way to mix up art practice as it\u2019s often on something I\u2019m not focusing on myself.\\n\\nLike Julia\u2019s room class:\\n\\n![](/img/artwork/drawclass-interiors.jpg)\\n\\nAnd Karina\u2019s dynamic pose class:\\n\\n![](/img/artwork/drawclass-dynamicposes-1.jpg)\\n\\n![](/img/artwork/drawclass-dynamicposes-2.jpg)\\n\\nI spent some time looking at Domestika and did buy a map drawing course because I thought it would be a nice skill to develop for making D&D locations. But I only ended up getting a few hours in before bouncing off it. Maybe I can revisit it during the winter holidays.\\n\\nMy favourite course of the year was probably Spencer Wan\u2019s 2D visual effects course. It was a very intense 3(4?) hours but covered techniques I\u2019d never seen before and really made a case for being an animator who specializes in effects. It felt like a course I could instantly take lessons from and apply them to Altar Stone videos. I shared my notes from it in my WAP 24 post (sparrows).\\n\\nMy course consumption will probably remain similar in 2025, Drawfee classes every month and a few one-offs here and there as they come up. \\n\\n## 2025\\n\\nI mentioned in one blog post already that I\u2019m starting the year off by doing a game jam with my wife. I suspect it will be a rather big challenge, even while trying to keep the scope reasonable, so I won\u2019t be doing any other art projects during the month. \\n\\nIn February I\u2019m going to try to do a style study of a select artist (I\u2019ve been putting together a list of artists I\u2019d like to learn from). I\u2019ve really been enjoying watching style study videos on YouTube and I\u2019ll try to follow a similar format of how [Thom O\'Clock](https://www.youtube.com/@thomoclock) does his Render Breakdown series. I found his video on [the art style of Hades](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abHLAgvhUGs) very inspiring both in process and execution. These types of things seem decently effortful and intimidating so I\u2019m setting my goals of doing 1 style study a month.\\n\\nAnother idea I have for a week-long project is a little less structured. I\u2019ve created 3 Pinterest boards for the year, one is a collection of interesting looking places, one a collection of characters I like, and another for colour schemes I\u2019d like to try. Once a month I\u2019m going to randomly choose a piece from each Pinboard by rolling dice and then combing the character in the location while using the selected colour scheme. This is a bit of practice for learning to draw from references, to try to develop more environmental design skills and also work with colours I wouldn\u2019t likely choose on my own.\\n\\nI feel like anatomy studies are still important to keep in the rotation, and there are some WAP themes I wish I had thought of earlier. So I think my 2025 months might look something like this:\\n\\n* Week 1: Style Study\\n* Week 2: Anatomy Week\\n* Week 3: 3 Board Challenge\\n* Week 4: Classic WAP\\n\\nI don\u2019t yet know how much effort style study weeks or Pinterest style pieces will take. So I may need to simplify my schedule in the future. What made WAP so doable was that it was the same rotation every week. I found ways to make some days easier over time from doing it over and over again. Not sure I\u2019ll have enough repeats to learn faster techniques for these new challenges but I\'m excited to get started."},{"id":"books-2024","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/books-2024","source":"@site/blog/2024-12-29-books-2024.md","title":"Books - 2024 review","description":"Books I read in 2024","date":"2024-12-29T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"books","permalink":"/blog/tags/books"}],"readingTime":7.525,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Kylie","title":"Admin","url":"https://github.com/kylies","imageURL":"https://github.com/kylies.png","key":"kylie","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Books - 2024 review","description":"Books I read in 2024","slug":"books-2024","authors":["kylie"],"tags":["books"],"image":"/img/2024-recap/top-books-2024.jpg"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"WAP Up","permalink":"/blog/wap-up"},"nextItem":{"title":"Weekly Art Practice - Week 40","permalink":"/blog/wap-40"}},"content":"I was able to stick to my 1 book a month goal this year, squeezing in 2 extras.

Doore\u2019s yearly roundup of Queer Adult Science Fiction & Fantasy Books](https://kadoore.com/2024/12/14/2024-queer-adult-science-fiction-fantasy-books/). I\u2019m hoping library access will help make discovery easier going forward, but it\u2019s a real shame how barely usable Libby is. An insult to app designers and librarians everywhere.\\n\\nBut on to the books. I tried writing this blog post a few times but found it was hard to talk about each one. So here are my top 3 and also my scoring (out of 3) for the rest.\\n\\n![](/img/2024-recap/top-books-2024.jpg)\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## Floating Hotel by Grace Curtis\\n\\n**Floating Hotel** was a surprise read of this year, I wouldn\u2019t have read it if it weren\u2019t for my wife hyping it up. It\u2019s kind of a cozy murder mystery in space. Its setting and writing are cozy while the characters and central story are more dramatic. A high end hotel well past its prime, travels between planets hosting celebrities and the rich. It\u2019s also a home to its staff, outcasts who can\u2019t return to their world or people running from their past. There\u2019s also a whole evil emperor and repressive education system thing going on but that\u2019s not really what things are about (but also is). \\n\\n## He Who Drowned The World by Shelley Parker-Chan\\n\\n**He Who Drowned The World** is the sequel and conclusion to She Who Became the Sun. These two books are a powerful duo and have probably one of my favourite leading characters ever. The duology is rather violent and graphic which makes me hesitate to recommend it to people. But the main character is so driven and the villains merciless. So much backstabbing and betrayal but also loyalty and commitment to people and causes.\\n\\n## A Psalm for the Wild-Built by Becky Chambers\\n\\nIt was nice to return to Becky Chambers after a few years. I loved her first 3 books but then I started to fall behind on her one-off releases. I really only got around to this one because our hold came up at the library. Compared to her other novels, which often take place in space, this one is set on a single planet (which I don\u2019t think is earth) where the people are recovering from near disaster. They had accidentally created AI. The society had been supported by robot labour for a long time, and then the robots gained sentience and they didn\u2019t want to labour for humans so they walked into the woods to disappear for a few decades. Just from that premise I was intrigued. Love the idea of a population of robots just peacing off to the woods, a common millennial wish. \\n\\n## The rest\\n\\n|Book | Thoughts | Rating out of 3|\\n| :---- | :---- | :---- |\\n| Siren Queen by Nghi Vo | Historical rise of movies in a slightly magical world where making deals with a devil figure is the norm. Not nearly as many sirens as I was hoping for, way too slow and prose-y for me. | 1 |\\n| Squid Empire by  Danna Staaf  | Non-fiction book about squid. Lots of good facts but I didn\u2019t love the overall structure and flow. | 2 |\\n| The Water Outlaws by S.L. Huang | A decent alt-history & magic adventure story. Has some similar vibes to things like She Who Became the Sun or The Poppy War but way less brutal. | 2 |\\n| Flux by Jinwoo Chong  | Had no idea what this was when I got into it. Was more sci-fi than expected and I liked how the main character was grappling with their childhood hero being exposed as a terrible guy. | 3 |\\n| Blood Ink Sister Scribe by Emma T\xf6rzs  | A fun adventure about magical books and those who can do magic. Got your classic rich boy and bodyguard duo, family members who haven\u2019t spoken in years, and many, many family secrets. | 3 |\\n| The Bookeaters by Sunyi Dean  | I was surprised at how dark this one started off for a book about a secret group of people who need to eat books to live. | 2 |\\n| Pers\xe9phone Station by Stina Leicht | Ragtag team of ex-soliders protects secret, peaceful aliens. There was a lot of world building going on here that I wish the author showed more of in the story. But a solid space adventure overall. | 2 |\\n| The Archive Undying by Emma Mieko Candon | Huge robots are gods and human interfaces are needed to\u2026 feed them? Control them? Power them? A very cool world but I wish the story had been divided into 2 books because So Much Happens. | 2 |\\n| The Cat Who Saves Books by Sosuke Natsukawa  | Kobo kept recommending this one to me so I finally bought it. Cute but a little childish and simple. I\u2019m kind of confused about who the intended audience is as it features high schoolers who go into alternative worlds to defend the value of books. The arguments are fairly basic but I think meant to be taken like a big deal. | 2 |\\n| The Familiar by Leigh Bardugo | I worry I have too high of expectations for Bardugo as I haven\u2019t really liked what she\u2019s done since Six of Crows. This was well done but felt more formulaic than her previous work. Wanted it to be a book about women surviving men but still ended with what I felt was a boring couple. | 2 |\\n| Light from Uncommon Stars by Ryka Aoki | A bit wild in its combo of student sacrifices and aliens who are running away from a cataclasm that threatens to end the known universe who are now running a doughnut shop. But its development and execution put it rather firmly in the \u201cnothing really bad will happen here\u201d camp.  | 2 |\\n| The Demon Haunted World by Carl Sagan and Ann Druyan | Another non-fiction, but I didn\u2019t finish this one as it was just way too long.  | Did not finish. |\\n| Hum by Helen Phillips  | So while I hated the ending (like a 2 page epilogue that nearly ruined the whole book for me. Just don\u2019t read the epilogue maybe?), this book did grip me from the start due to the way the main character acted and just had me on edge the whole time. Doesn\u2019t deserve to be called an \u201cAI\u201d book but does say some stuff about the current state of the world. | 2 |\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nI rated a lot of the books a 2, and looking back on the year, it fits. There were few like, standout, amazing books that I read this year. But there was a general good enough consistency which helped me keep up my reading pace.\\n\\nThere were a lot of robots in books this year and I suspect that will continue as everyone is writing about AI now. I really loved the books I read in the last like 7ish years that had central AI plots or characters but now it feels a bit more like the \u201ctrendy thing\u201d and I suspect the median quality of AI stories will be lower. And with Muderbot being turned into a TV series I worry more.\\n\\nThe other night I started reading To Shape a Dragon\'s Breath by Moniquill Blackgoose and I saw that there were 2 other books on the K.A. Doore list that mentioned dragons so now I\u2019m kind of hoping 2025 is about dragon books. Feel those nostalgic Dragonriders of Pern feelings. Though I should probably assume that a new dragon trend is more likely brought about from Game of Thrones / House of the Dragon being huge TV hits. But as a kid who grew up obsessed with dragons, it\u2019s always nice to see more of them."},{"id":"wap-40","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/wap-40","source":"@site/blog/2024-12-28-week40.md","title":"Weekly Art Practice - Week 40","description":"Week 40 - Revisits","date":"2024-12-28T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"art","permalink":"/blog/tags/art"},{"inline":true,"label":"wap","permalink":"/blog/tags/wap"}],"readingTime":1.29,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Kylie","title":"Admin","url":"https://github.com/kylies","imageURL":"https://github.com/kylies.png","key":"kylie","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Weekly Art Practice - Week 40","description":"Week 40 - Revisits","slug":"wap-40","authors":["kylie"],"tags":["art","wap"],"Image":"/img/wap/wap-40.1.2.jpg"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Books - 2024 review","permalink":"/blog/books-2024"},"nextItem":{"title":"Video games - 2024 review","permalink":"/blog/games-2024"}},"content":"WAP 40, the final WAP of 2024!\\n\\nThis is another week of revisiting animal subjects of the last year.

This year I\u2019m going to try organizing things a little differently. I liked a lot of games this year. Made a dent in my backlog, played some of the top regarded games of the year, and a lot of them were hits with me. So this will probably read like a long list of game recommendations. \\n\\nUnlike your typical \'Best Of\' list, I\u2019m starting with my top games of the year instead of saving them for the end. Why make the people wait. Or read.\\n\\n![](/img/2024-recap/top-games-2024.jpg)\\n\\n**Cobalt Core** was a very early game in the year for me. It came out in November 2023 so I wasn\u2019t too far from release when I picked it up. It\u2019s a deck builder disguised as a ship builder roguelike. I was almost turned off of it once I realized how many playthroughs were needed to unlock the full ending but the gameplay kept bringing me back. And eventually I found a rather consistent ship build that got me wins 70% of the time. The art is rather cutesy but I thought it had great humour and writing.\\n\\nProbably don\u2019t need to say much about the **Elden Ring DLC** since I had put Elden Ring in my top games last year. But for me I think I got a more true Elden Ring experience in the DLC than I did in the main game. I had watched my wife play through Elden Ring before I really got hooked so there wasn\u2019t much mystery for me and I kind of just focused on the main line and one build. In the DLC I explored (nearly) every nook and cranny, going for a near completionist run without really trying. Just felt fully In It. People still complain about the DLC\u2019s use of Shadowseeds as necessary for progressing in the game power-wise but I find their complaints unjustified and thought it was actually a clever way to reward exploration and not rushing through. While also not taking away your powers since many people were coming into the DLC after beating the main game.\\n\\n**Return of the Obra Dinn** was one that has been on my to-play list since it came out. But I didn\u2019t love the visual style so I hesitated. Wanting to play more games on my Switch this year because I could then play games in the bath, I finally got it. And then played it for nearly 6 hours straight. Excellent mystery design, such a unique progression, so much UI design making it playable. Instantly became a game I encourage everyone to play.\\n\\n## Puzzlers\\n\\nSo I said I was going to try to break things down a little differently. Mostly because there have been so many good games this year but they\u2019ve all been very different styles. Obra Dinn wasn\u2019t my first puzzle game of the year, I started with **Cocoon,** one of the top games from 2023. I loved how straightforward Cocoon was, how it made you feel just clever enough. While also giving you very minimal storytelling, you mostly went on vibes. I also like to describe it as a game for people who want to ponder over some orbs.\\n\\n![The meme of a wizard gazing at an orb but the orb has been replaced by the Cocoon orb within an orb.](/img/2024-recap/ponder-orb.jpg)\\n\\n**Animal Well** was a more search-action platform puzzler. Another really unique style, interesting game play, but the extensive puzzles going levels deep was too much for me. I still think the game is great and I recommend it for people and tell them it feels good even just reaching the first credits. But I would have loved to have the experience of playing it at the same time as friends and sharing discoveries and maybe trying to figure out some of the more obtuse secrets.\\n\\nAnother one from the backlog was **Chants of Sennaar**. I don\u2019t feel like this game ever got much hype but it was talked about on a gaming podcast I listen to and I was rather taken with the art style when I looked it up. The central game mechanic is deciphering languages used by different castes in a society so that you can try to figure out what\u2019s going on. It has a similar game feel as Obra Dinn, where you are dragging and dropping your answers to the puzzles into menu slots. Which honestly, is probably where they got the design idea from and where the next game, **The Case of the Golden Idol**, likely got inspiration from too.\\n\\nGolden Idol is a series of scenes, each containing mysteries you piece together through a bit of point and click investigating. It was really fun, and deployed a hint system that was enough to help me with a puzzle whenever I got stuck. I really like that as a mechanic because even though every game has been walkthrough to death online, it\u2019s really nice to not pick up your phone and look for help and just be able to stay in the game.\\n\\nI would honestly recommend all these games, I felt like they were all unique and all offered something a little different.\\n\\n## Gatchas\\n\\nWhile **Genshin Impact** is still my main gatcha game (I still play nearly every day), I tested the waters of a few others this year.\\n\\n**Zenless Zone Zero** is the newest Mihoyo game, one I was pretty excited for after years of small teases. I ended up only playing for 2 days before deciding it wasn\u2019t really for me. I liked the character design, I liked the combat, but the general execution of being more locked into quests after the open world freedom of Genshin felt very restrictive. But I also knew it would want as much time as Genshin does and it\u2019s hard to balance multiple huge games like that at the same time.\\n\\nFor a little over a month my wife and I played **AFK Journey**. This was also a time sink but it was when I wanted to get off Twitter so I was trying to get into the habit of opening games on my phone instead of opening brain numbing apps. It was fun while it lasted but didn\u2019t have the staying power of Genshin to keep us coming back.\\n\\nThere are two gatchas that are staying a little better. **Pokemon TCG Pocket**, a game that\u2019s mostly focused on giving you that \u201cpulls\u201d feeling. As it does give you 2 pulls every day without you having to do anything besides login. If this wasn\u2019t such a strong IP I don\u2019t think this game would last but it takes minimal time commitment and I love looking at Pokemon.\\n\\nThe other is **Infinity Nikki** which I thought I\u2019d play for a week and then bounce but I\u2019m now on week 3 or so and have basically embraced it as my killing time while tired game while waiting for the next big Genshin content drop. Infinity Nikki is very unique in its focus on fashion and story over combat, and I do love playing dress-up. But I will be surprised if I stick with this game longer than winter break.\\n\\n## Not good enough at\\n\\nI consider myself pretty good at video games. I have what I consider decent reflexes and hand eye coordination for my age, enjoy puzzle solving and also believe in having to put the time in to get good at something. So I find it rare that I bounce off a game because I\u2019m just not getting it. But it happened twice this year.\\n\\nOne was for **Pacific Drive**, a game I was very excited about because I loved some of its early trailers. But after multiple failed journeys in my car, and having to re-do missions over and over again, I just lost motivation. I felt like I was missing a key understanding for being able to get through even early missions. I saw some other people online with a similar complaint, and they were mostly told to \u201cget good\u201d. Others suggested that there were a few difficulty settings that can be changed. So if I do ever return to this I\u2019d probably turn those on and try to enjoy the mystery of the world more.\\n\\n**Rollderdrome** was the other game I put down. I\u2019d heard lots of good things about it and was super intrigued by the game player and weird setting, but I didn\u2019t love the game feel. And the fact that you just went match to match without much going on between challenges meant I didn\u2019t have much to latch onto besides the game play.\\n\\n## The rest\\n\\nOkay I tried being organized but there are only a few left and they don\u2019t really fit in a nice category.\\n\\n**Dave the Diver**, one of last year\'s huge breakouts. I had a lot of fun with this and was blown away by the pixel art. I put a lot of time into it even though it got rather repetitive and honestly killing fish over and over again didn\u2019t feel great. But it had such addictive pacing.\\n\\n**Night in the Woods** was my only VN-esque game this year. A famously beloved indie darling that is very well executed and had a twist I didn\u2019t see coming. It was also a nice length with good writing overall. Which is why it often came up in my game circles since I spend a lot of time talking about storytelling and writing in games. So I knew I had to get to this one eventually and I\u2019m happy I finally did.\\n\\nAnd I replayed **Hades**. I had a strong urge to start playing early access Hades 2 but when trying to balance how much time you play video games versus other things I didn\u2019t want to put 30 hours into Hades 2 knowing I would likely put in those same 30 hours on the full release. So I will keep trying to avoid any spoilers for Hades 2 and just hope that it gets a full release soon.\\n\\nThis feels a bit like a ridiculous amount of games to play in a year, but most of them were nice, reasonably sized experiences. The puzzlers were in the 5-12 hours of gameplayer area. Dave the Diver and Elden Ring were probably the only games I put in over 30 hours. I\u2019ve just really come to enjoy a video game that I can start playing on a Friday evening and wrap it up by Sunday evening. Just a nice weekend experience.\\n\\nI do have a list of games I\u2019d like to play in 2025 and I think most should also be in the smaller game category. Which does make me curious for what huge game will be able to grab me next, as there\u2019s nothing on my radar for releases in 2025 that seems like a contender. Unless Hades 2 does a surprise drop..."},{"id":"wap-39","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/wap-39","source":"@site/blog/2024-12-21-week39.md","title":"Weekly Art Practice - Week 39","description":"Week 39 - Revisits 1","date":"2024-12-21T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"art","permalink":"/blog/tags/art"},{"inline":true,"label":"wap","permalink":"/blog/tags/wap"}],"readingTime":1.72,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Kylie","title":"Admin","url":"https://github.com/kylies","imageURL":"https://github.com/kylies.png","key":"kylie","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Weekly Art Practice - Week 39","description":"Week 39 - Revisits 1","slug":"wap-39","authors":["kylie"],"tags":["art","wap"],"Image":"/img/wap/wap-39.1.jpg"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Video games - 2024 review","permalink":"/blog/games-2024"},"nextItem":{"title":"Weekly Art Practice - Week 38","permalink":"/blog/wap-38"}},"content":"For these last 2 WAP weeks, I decided to change it up.

So I let myself re-read the original blog post and scroll through the Pintrest page of images before I settled in to do some drawing.\\n\\n## Day 1 - Squirrels\\n\\nStill love squirrels, happy to revisit them.

There are 3 subjects that are often either ridiculed or acknowledged as being weirdly difficult to draw. Hands, horses, bikes. These likely aren\u2019t the hardest for everyone but they come up and have been on my mind since starting this year long project. At the start of the year I did hands, just a few weeks ago horses, so it felt like it was time to stop avoiding bikes.\\n\\n## Day 1 - Drawing from imagination\\n\\nPretty awful. I see bikes probably every single day, Montreal is a very active bike city, but it\u2019s not enough for me to summon up bikes clearly in my mind. \\n\\n![](/img/wap/wap-38.1.jpg)\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## Day 2 - Figure sketching\\n\\nDay two saw improvements quickly just by being able to look at some photos. However, a quick discovery: not that many exciting photos of bikes.\\n\\n![Quick hand sketches using references](/img/wap/wap-38.2.jpg)\\n\\n## Day 3 - Reference studies\\n\\nThe realization from day 2 was quickly apparent on day 3, the photos aren\u2019t exciting and drawing bikes\u2026 also not exciting. Is drawing bikes hard because imagining a bike isn\u2019t fun? I really had to push myself to just start working on bikes each day.\\n\\n![](/img/wap/wap-38.3.1.jpg)\\n\\n![](/img/wap/wap-38.3.2.jpg)\\n\\n## Day 4 - Style studies\\n\\nThings got a little nicer on day 4 if only because the references I chose to work with were big on simplification. Not including all the tiny metal bits in the wheels is a huge time saver and takes away the annoying act of having to draw 40 lines.\\n\\n![](/img/wap/wap-38.4.jpg)\\n\\nReference: [Sketchy bikes on VectorStock](https://www.vectorstock.com/royalty-free-vector/bicyclist-rider-mans-bike-hand-drawn-sketch-vector-6224107) and [Diana-Huang on DeviantArt](https://www.deviantart.com/diana-huang/art/Draw-People-on-Bicycles-and-Tricycles-510867169).\\n\\n## Day 5 - Drawing from imagination\\n\\nI put off day 5 for as long as I could because even though I found drawing bikes to be fairly boring I was afraid that boredom had stopped any memory of the shape of a bike from my mind. I was certain I was going to draw some kind of bike abomination. \\n\\nBut I decided to take it super slow and draw with some perspective to mix things up. Only to draw the best bike I\u2019ve ever seen. Plus another bike in profile which is okay but doesn\u2019t feel like as much of an accomplishment.\\n\\n![](/img/wap/wap-38.5.jpg)\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nEven though I\u2019m proud of the bike I drew on day 5 I\u2019m still a little torn about this week. Inanimate objects just aren\u2019t as interesting to approach this way due to their lack of movement and change. Living creatures have multiple shapes, sizes, motions, bikes just kind of\u2026 are.

I did a fair bit of YouTube research for this one and I\u2019ll share the resources that were most helpful or insightful throughout the blog post.\\n\\n## Step 1 - Pose\\n\\nFollowing the workflow learn from character design week, step one was to focus on the pose only. Starting from Pinterest I gathered up a bunch of references of original Pokemon trainer artwork as well as a few modern interpretations.\\n\\nI tried out a few poses, 2 from game references and one that just felt like it really fit the aggressive trainer look.\\n\\n![](/img/wap/wap-34.1.jpg)\\n\\nI didn\u2019t deviate too much from the original poses, wanting this week to be more about design and technique than anatomy or dynamic posing. For proportions, faces, and general shape design, [Rjamez Valdez 4 piece trainer tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sratMdLyzvw) is absolutely excellent. This is someone who has spent a lot of time studying the originals and also drawing trainers. He breaks down each feature to make it seem easy.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## Step 2 - Design\\n\\nDesign is one of my weaknesses but I feel like by doing 3 mandatory base sketches I\u2019m finally starting to find ways to work around my weaknesses. I definitely used to just do 1 sketch and run with it, but now, for a lot of my work, I try to force at least 3 iterations to either get out of my comfort zone or increase the appeal of the original sketch.\\n\\n![3 copies of the pose sketch, each with a different hair and clothing style.](/img/wap/wap-34.2.jpg)\\n\\n## Step 3 - Lines & Colours\\n\\nSo I messed up the process already. I should have forced myself to stay in step one longer because I really wasn\u2019t happy with the hands. But the problem was that I had done them to match the reference image but then when looking at them again and trying out the hand pose in real life, it just didn\u2019t make sense. So I ended up doing half the lines and then having to pause to re-work both hands over and over again. Even had my wife take a photo of my hand in the pose I wanted so I could use it as a visual reference.\\n\\n![](/img/wap/wap-34.3.jpg)\\n\\nOnce I finally had the lines done I generated a colour palette from an image of mainline Pokemon trainers of the last 15-ish years. The palette of Pokemon art is rather specific so I didn\u2019t want to choose colours on my own. They\u2019re a combo of being rather muted with a few instances of strong saturation. I struggle with that balance so I tried to stay on the muted end of things. Which led to more beige than I really wanted\u2026\\n\\n## Step 4 - Rendering\\n\\nPokemon art has a very soft watercolour look to it. Where the original game work might have been done completely traditionally with water colours. Which makes for a challenge to duplicate digitally. But many have tried and I\u2019ll share their experiences in the conclusion. I didn\u2019t have to do too much experimenting as I was able to take other people\u2019s brush recommendations and run with it.\\n\\n![](/img/wap/wap-34.4.jpg)\\n\\nThe shading is rather hard in Pokemon art, with some harsh lines. While the light is rather\u2026 light. I think what a lot of people learned was that you should be resisting the smudge tool and trying to keep those hard lines. I however, did not resist the smudge tool and ended up smudging most of my shadows as I didn\u2019t like how hard they looked. I even did multiple shadow passes to add some harder lines back in after. I think this has led to way too much texture in the image which the original style doesn\u2019t really have.\\n\\n## Step 5 - Adding a team\\n\\nThere are a lot of cute original trainer art pieces out on the internet. I copied their format of including your Pokemon team next to the trainer art. I didn\u2019t want to spend a lot of time on the Pokemon so I just did quick sketch + lines and colour picked from the sprites to fill them in, then a touch of minimal shading.\\n\\n![](/img/wap/wap-34.5.jpg)\\n\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nThe most in-depth and helpful video on learning this style was [Mastering The Pokemon Art style! - Master Study](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPyS9u3e5yg) by IMTHEJOHKE. He does an intense 3 day style study in a format that I\u2019d like to try out in the future. He talks about his experimentation to get the right look and also about his research. And it was funny to see him reference another style study video which happened to be the one I had watched just before, Subjectively\u2019s [How to Draw in the Pokemon Style](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYrUE17SgdA).\\n\\nSubjectively\u2019s video was more focused on the Pokemon of Pokemon games but he shared the brushes he used in Procreate. Since the line and colouring style of Pokemon art is so unique this was a game changer for everyone in the comments.\\n\\n![And image showing two Procreate brushes. The first being Gesinski Ink and the next Procreate\'s Flat Brush. ](/img/wap/pokemon-brushes.jpg)\\n\\nThis is a screenshot from IMTHEJOHKE\'s video.\\n\\nSo while IMTHEJOHKE and Subjectively were really able to break down some of the larger pieces of the Pokemon style and how to replicate it digitally, I found Rjamez Valdez\u2019s video series to be key to really making trainers. He seems to publish 1 video a year and has promised another one so I guess I\u2019ll be waiting for that one to drop some day.\\n\\nI haven\u2019t done a style study like this before and it was really fun to go from idea to research to execution. It wouldn\u2019t have been so easy if there wasn\u2019t already people who had done the hard work and condensed their discovery into YouTube videos, so a challenge to myself will be to do a style study on my own instead of just second hand. But those are projects I hope to take into next year!\\n\\nPinterest board [of Pokemon trainers](https://ca.pinterest.com/maeanu3639/pok%C3%A9mon-trainers/)."},{"id":"wap-33","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/wap-33","source":"@site/blog/2024-11-03-week33.md","title":"Weekly Art Practice - Week 33","description":"Week 33 - Swimming","date":"2024-11-03T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"art","permalink":"/blog/tags/art"},{"inline":true,"label":"wap","permalink":"/blog/tags/wap"}],"readingTime":0.94,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Kylie","title":"Admin","url":"https://github.com/kylies","imageURL":"https://github.com/kylies.png","key":"kylie","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Weekly Art Practice - Week 33","description":"Week 33 - Swimming","slug":"wap-33","authors":["kylie"],"tags":["art","wap"],"Image":"/img/wap/wap-33.4.2.jpg"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Weekly Art Practice - Week 34","permalink":"/blog/wap-34"},"nextItem":{"title":"Weekly Art Practice - Week 32","permalink":"/blog/wap-32"}},"content":"Action anatomy week, swimming.

So along with the regular subject studies, and anatomy studies, I want to try to work in a \u201cfinished piece\u201d once a month (even if there are only 2 left\u2026). For me a finished piece mostly just means fully rendered to a degree where I\u2019m happy to share it on socials. These will mostly be chosen from current internet art trends or challenges as I like to know my theme going into the week.\\n\\nThe theme for this week is the Pokemon Ability Forms exercise. All Pokemon have an ability, this is usually between two abilities with some Pokemon getting a 3rd hidden ability. Abilities will provide Pokemon with an extra, often passive, mechanic during combat. For example: Pikachu most often has the ability Static, which means that when an opposing Pokemon makes physical contact with that Pikachu, there is a 1 in 3 chance the opposing Pokemon is paralyzed by the static.\\n\\nThe idea behind this challenge is what if a Pokemon\u2019s ability changed the way the Pokemon physically appeared. So a Pikachu with the ability Static might have static electricity jumping all over its fur. I heard of the exercise from a recent [Drawfee episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XAskhVaGu4Y) and did some research to try to find the originator of the exercise and I\u2019ve come to believe it was started by [n0rtist](https://www.tumblr.com/n0rtist) with this [Tumblr post](https://n0rtist.tumblr.com/post/752603925067268096/what-if-abilities-changed-the-appearance-of-a) (Sounds like it may have been a Tweet first but Twitter is impossible to use now).\\n\\nI like it as a challenge because it\u2019s a design challenge with an existing character. So not a full head to toe design but working off of basically one word and a one sentence description to make changes with.\\n\\nBut anyway this is a lot of preamble for a blog post, let\u2019s get into it.\\n\\n## Day 1 - Research & Sketches\\n\\nI spent a decent amount of time scrolling a list of all Pokemon and reading their abilities. I wanted one that had 2 basic ones and a hidden ability to have 3 characters to draw. I went with Omastar because I have a soft spot for him after his role in the original Twitch Plays Pokemon and I wanted to keep drawing ocean creatures. He also has 3 abilities that I was able to imagine some solid visual elements right from the get go.\\n\\nAfter doing the research phase I did some quick first idea sketches:\\n\\n![](/img/wap/wap-32.1.jpg)\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## Day 2 - Digital sketches\\n\\nInstead of bringing my hand sketches into a digital format I re-did them in CSP to spend a little more time thinking about poses and design.\\n\\n![Sketches in red digital pencil of 3 omastars](/img/wap/wap-32.2.jpg)\\n\\n## Day 3 - Swift Swim\\n\\nFor Swift Swim I wanted longer tentacles for swimming but also a slightly more aerodynamic shell for faster movement in water.\\n\\n![](/img/wap/wap-32.3.jpg)\\n\\n## Day 4 - Shell Armor\\n\\nI was torn between how big to go with Shell Armor, some of my earlier sketches definitely had more of the body covered but it ended up looking to diaper-like to me. I\u2019m pretty happy with the helmet look though.\\n\\n![](/img/wap/wap-32.4.jpg)\\n\\n\\n## Day 5 - Weak Armor\\n\\nWeak Armor was probably the hardest design wise. How I conceptualised it was that on hit, the weak armor would break off and this makes the Pokemon faster as it\u2019s carrying around less weight. Possibly even has some cool regenerate ability but I wasn\u2019t sure how to visually represent that. So I just went with some big pieces being knocked off but still ready to fight.\\n\\nThis one is pink because that\'s the Omastar shiny variant.\\n\\n![](/img/wap/wap-32.5.jpg)\\n\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nOnce completed I put them all on a page with some experimental design so it wasn\u2019t just a plain white background.\\n\\n![](/img/omastar-abilityforms.jpg)\\n\\nI really enjoyed this project. I don\u2019t do design stuff often so it was a nice creative stretch. Dividing it into 1 character per day was also a nice breakdown as they each only took 1-2 hours depending on how confident I was in the sketch and after I figured out the painting method I wanted to use. It\u2019s probably not noticeable but I did a light, textured white paint over the base colours to tone down the colours a bit. Original Pokemon artwork was in water colours so a lot of Pokemon art tries to emulate that and I liked the slightly softer look it gave this.\\n\\nI used a web app to get the Omastar name in that font: [Pokemon Fonts Generator](https://pokemon-fonts-generator.netlify.app/)"},{"id":"wap-31","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/wap-31","source":"@site/blog/2024-10-19-week31.md","title":"Weekly Art Practice - Week 31","description":"Week 31 - Flowers","date":"2024-10-19T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"art","permalink":"/blog/tags/art"},{"inline":true,"label":"wap","permalink":"/blog/tags/wap"}],"readingTime":2.96,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Kylie","title":"Admin","url":"https://github.com/kylies","imageURL":"https://github.com/kylies.png","key":"kylie","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Weekly Art Practice - Week 31","description":"Week 31 - Flowers","slug":"wap-31","authors":["kylie"],"tags":["art","wap"],"Image":"/img/wap/wap-31.5.jpg"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Weekly Art Practice - Week 32","permalink":"/blog/wap-32"},"nextItem":{"title":"Weekly Art Practice - Week 30","permalink":"/blog/wap-30"}},"content":"This week\u2019s practice is another vague and ambitious theme; flowers. Vague because there are so many different kinds of flowers and ambitious because I often feel like I only know 5 flowers. But I see flowers constantly as they are probably the most common tattoo theme and I follow a lot of tattoo artists on Instagram. But I myself rarely draw them. So I thought it would be good to practice since they are such a common theme in art.\\n\\n## Day 1 - Drawing from imagination\\n\\nNot a terrible day one?\\n\\n![](/img/wap/wap-31.1.jpg)\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## Day 2 - Figure sketching\\n\\nWhen researching flowers it was a bit of a case of \u201cI want to draw that one and that one and that one etc.\u201d. There are a lot of interesting shapes out there so it was hard to choose to focus on a select few to get good at those or to keep trying new ones to try to internalise more ways flowers can look.\\n\\n![Quick hand sketches using references](/img/wap/wap-31.2.jpg)\\n\\n## Day 3 - Reference studies\\n\\nEasily could have spent hours doing reference studies as I found these to be pretty relaxing.

(okay probably human bodies due to everyone\u2019s efforts to do figure drawing practice). I probably could have scrolled Pinterest for hours for reference images but I knew it was a trap and grabbed the first few slightly different looking ones I found.\\n\\nI worked on a few of these on the train and I felt the rocky, unsteadiness of the train added a nice jitter to my line work that made the petals look more organic.\\n\\n![](/img/wap/wap-31.4.1.jpg)\\n\\nReference: Pantone flowers by ???

Hydrangeas were lots of fun but drawing so many little flowers was definitely time consuming.\\n\\nBeen thinking a lot about how I want my art practice to change in 2025 which has led to thinking a lot about master studies. I\u2019ve been watching videos of other people doing master studies and they always look like, like trying to solve a mystery or a puzzle. But they do also look rather intense so I\u2019m not sure what\u2019s a realistic goal for doing studies. 1 a week? 1 a month?\\n\\nBut I\u2019d also like to start working on pieces I\u2019m comfortable sharing as even though I\u2019ve been drawing consistently all year, none of my weekly practice pieces are finished pieces. And while studies are important they aren\u2019t really, fully \u201cyours\u201d. So I also want to find a way to work on new personal art more. Still have a few months to figure it all out.\\n\\nPinterest board [of flowers](https://ca.pinterest.com/maeanu3639/wap-flowers/)."},{"id":"wap-30","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/wap-30","source":"@site/blog/2024-10-06-week30.md","title":"Weekly Art Practice - Week 30","description":"Week 30 - Sugar Gliders","date":"2024-10-06T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"art","permalink":"/blog/tags/art"},{"inline":true,"label":"wap","permalink":"/blog/tags/wap"}],"readingTime":2.195,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Kylie","title":"Admin","url":"https://github.com/kylies","imageURL":"https://github.com/kylies.png","key":"kylie","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Weekly Art Practice - Week 30","description":"Week 30 - Sugar Gliders","slug":"wap-30","authors":["kylie"],"tags":["art","wap"],"Image":"/img/wap/wap-30.5.jpg"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Weekly Art Practice - Week 31","permalink":"/blog/wap-31"},"nextItem":{"title":"Weekly Art Practice - Week 29","permalink":"/blog/wap-29"}},"content":"Week 30!

I\u2019m starting to try to figure out how I want to approach art practice next year now. I don\u2019t think I want to keep doing WAP guided practice, I feel like I should get out of the comfort zone and try to move into working on complete pieces.

Possibly because they aren\u2019t a North American creature. We had endless sources for creatures like raccoons, rabbits, pigeons, etc. But also Pinterest is a pretty garbage website as when I go to collect my references at the end of the week there are suddenly more results and I struggle to find the ones I used.

When I don\u2019t have a main project on the go, like an Altar Stone background, I often open Procreate, look at not finished pieces, and then just close it.

This has been a fun creative challenge and our first attempt at bundling more \u201cworth\u201d into the video projects. These are the first 3 we\'ve shared.\\n\\nWe are basing the items off of 5e (2014) for now. Might be fun to revisit the mechanics if we personally branch out to other systems in this golden age of new TTRPG releases.\\n\\n## Abyssal Harp\\n\\n![](/img/altar-stone/AS-harp.png)\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n*Wondrous item, instrument, very rare (requires attunement by a bard),*\\n*5lbs*\\n\\nAn instrument of the submerged Eighth College, this harp takes the form of a series of interconnected tubes mounted on a frame of coral. When moved through water in a precise and fluid motion, the harp creates sound vibrations and subtle changes in water pressure that are perceived as ethereal music by the listener.\\n\\nWhile you are fully immersed in water and holding this harp, the current adds its voice to yours when you cast spells. You gain a +1 bonus to the saving throw DC of your bard spells and a +1 bonus to Constitution saving throws made to maintain concentration on a spell.\\n\\nWhile you are holding this harp, you can cast *prestidigitation* as an action. Illusions created with this spell take on a watery character: visual illusions shimmer and waver, while auditory illusions are deep and sonorous. Once per day, as an action, you can use the harp to cast *create or destroy water* as a 5th level spell. This property recharges at dawn, whether or not the sun is visible at your current depth.\\n\\nThe harp can only be played underwater. The vibrations and pressure changes it generates are imperceptible in air or empty space. When affixed to an underwater surface in an area with strong currents, the harp will seemingly play itself as water flows through it, allowing the ocean to speak with a gentler voice and for the patient listener to hear the musings of its queen.\\n\\n## Rod of Reanimation\\n\\n![](/img/altar-stone/AS-rod.jpg)\\n\\n*Wondrous item, rod, very rare (requires attunement by a wizard, warlock, or sorcerer),*\\n*10lbs*\\n\\nThis rod of crystal and steel is topped with a transparent sphere, inside which arc and sputter streams of blue and purple lightning. Adventurers are advised not to spend undue time considering the origin of the fluid that circulates within the handle.\\n\\nThe rod has 3 charges. While you hold it, you can use an action and consume a charge to cast one of the following spells from it: *animate dead* or *lightning bolt*. As charges are consumed, the fluid within the handle depletes proportionately. The charges (and the fluid) return at dawn.\\n\\nCreatures reanimated by the Rod have the property *Came Back Wrong*. At the beginning of the creature\u2019s turn, roll a ten-sided die.\\n\\n| Roll | Condition |\\n|:-------|:-----------------|\\n| 1      | The creature cannot act this turn. If the creature was capable of speech in life, it begs for death from the nearest creature. Otherwise, it howls in wordless agony.                |\\n| 2-3    | The creature goes into a wild rage, screaming and attacking the nearest creature with all its strength. It makes a melee attack roll with an additional +2 to hit and a 1d6 bonus to damage.                |\\n| 4-10  | The creature behaves normally this turn.                |\\n\\n## Glass of Sands\\n\\n![](/img/altar-stone/AS-hourglass.png)\\n\\n*Wondrous item, legendary,*\\n*5lbs*\\n\\nWithin the hourglass, discovered in the outstretched hand of a withered corpse, the sands swirl without cease as if scattered by eternal sirocco. When you pick it up, you feel as though you can hear the wind inside, the susurrus of a thousand thousand imprisoned in dust.\\n\\nOnce a week, as an action, you may cast any one spell of 8th level or less on your class\u2019s spell list by turning the glass upside down and reciting the incantation inscribed along its edges. While the sand is flowing, time is paused for the user as the hourglass draws power from within the core of their soul to assemble the energies necessary for the spell. Consult the table below to determine how much your character ages as a result of using this feature.\\n\\n| Spell level | Duration |\\n|:-------|:-----------------|\\n| 1 | 1 month   |\\n| 2 | 2 months |\\n| 3 | 3 months |\\n| 4 | 5 months |\\n| 5 | 8 months |\\n| 6 | 1 year       |\\n| 7 | 2 years     |\\n| 8 | 3 years     |\\n\\nWhile time is paused, the hourglass\u2019s holder cannot act, and only the sand within the hourglass moves. The rest of the world is held in suspension. The subjective duration of the time freeze for both the user and those in the vicinity is left to the GM.\\n\\nIf the hourglass is shattered, the soul-dust within is freed, and each fleck will spend the remainder of its existence attempting to locate and re-incorporate with the soul that shed it.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nNext week is back to regular WAP posting. I may have chosen an anatomy challenge that\u2019s too complicated but we\u2019ll see if it can be done without learning the anatomy of horses\u2026\\n\\nI ended up downloading Resprite on the iPad so I\u2019ve been poking around at pixel art a bit. Hoping to try out animating in a few weeks when I look up a tutorial on how to properly use the app. But also a bunch of my Clippy points were going to expire so I went on a big Clip Studio Paint spending spree and now have a bunch of new brushes I want to experiment with.

Still images of raccoons don\u2019t really show the silliness and mischievousness. I wanted to try to capture that in chip raccoon. Sleeping raccoon was from a photo I remembered seeing and then the sitting guy was just me trying to get the shape right from memory.\\n\\n![](/img/wap/wap-28.5.jpg)\\n\\n## Software contemplations\\n\\nThere\u2019s been a lot of new iPad apps dropping over the last year that I\u2019m currently tempted by. I feel like 3 years ago when I was looking for 3D modelling things there were zero options. Then a few weeks ago I learned of [Nomad Sculpt](https://nomadsculpt.com/) which people compare favourably to Blender (which is desktop only). And then very recently [ZBrush](https://www.maxon.net/en/zbrush-for-ipad) also released an iPad version of their software. I\u2019m not familiar enough with the existing software to draw my own conclusions and everything is still pretty recent so I haven\u2019t found great comparison articles or videos yet.\\n\\nBut I\u2019d like to mess around with 3D models next year so I\u2019ll keep trying to find a good option. Blender is free but being desktop only is a downside for me as my laptop is starting to show its age so the iPad is the more reliable hardware choice.\\n\\nI\u2019ve also been eyeing [Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org/) for pixel art, but again, it doesn\u2019t have an iPad version. People recommend [Resprite](https://resprite.fengeon.com/) for iPad, but the main thing people say Aseprite does better is video game assets and video game assets are my long term goals. So it feels like the wrong choice to go for the inferior choice when I know what I\u2019m trying to do. There\u2019s also just a very noticeable lack of Resprite tutorials out there, but there is a wealth of Aseprite tutorials.\\n\\nJust feeling stuck in choices right now and wishing there were more people writing and comparing these softwares. But all I can really get info from is Reddit posts :|\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nRunning a bit behind on art due to having a very busy week last week.

The instructure spent a decent amount of time talking about material painting and using it to livin up your character\'s look. I struggled with the focus on metal as I didn\u2019t feel like I had enough time in the 1 day devoted to materials to really learn, and instead just ended up trying to fake it. But after that I added Material Studies to my list of upcoming WAPs, and now we finally got there.\\n\\nI started by gathering up material step-by-step guides I could find on Pinterest. The most common ones are gold and metal, but the metadata on these things isn\u2019t great so it was hard to keep searching for more, broader themes. Out of the ones I found I choose 5 that feel like decent beginner materials, by which I probably mean most common. I also choose ones that had the most understandable guides, preferring ones that also had text that explained the steps.\\n\\n## Day 1 - Wood\\n\\nI find wood rather intimidating to paint, I suspect others do too as it\u2019s very easy to find a brush to do the effect. It\u2019s my go-to move for Altar Stone videos or other backgrounds where I need to do a large piece of wood because the idea of drawing all the needed lines is exhausting. But that\u2019s what we did on day 1.\\n\\n![](/img/wap/wap-27.1.jpg)\\n\\nI\u2019m very happy with how this went, even though I did get lost in the steps for a while. The instructions could be more clear. I didn\u2019t add as many scratches but that was mostly because I felt like the ones I did do were enough to learn what was going on. This piece also came together rather quickly which was a nice discovery, making the idea of doing hand drawn wood objects in the future less daunting.\\n\\n[Wood tutorial](https://www.deviantart.com/gimaldinov/art/How-to-draw-wooden-plank-267517599) by\\nGimaldinov. I found this version of the tutorial while putting the blog post together and now I see that there were more steps! I didn\u2019t know about the last few!\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## Day 2 - Gold\\n\\nGold felt pretty straight forward and was the fastest of the bunch. I do feel like I\u2019ve lost some texture and I could have pushed the highlights harder.\\n\\n![A step by step guide on how to paint gold next to a large golden chalice.](/img/wap/wap-27.2.jpg)\\n\\nGold tutorial by [Colin Adams](https://www.colinadams.com/).\\n\\n## Day 3 - Metal\\n\\nI hesitated on doing metal and gold on back to back days, thinking they would feel too similar. But I tried to focus on fixing the texture problem which led to some impressive results. At least after my first attempt which turned into a smudged mess.\\n\\n![](/img/wap/wap-27.3.jpg)\\n\\nA big struggle with the instructions for these things is that it\u2019s not clear how you\u2019re meant to be painting. Not everyone suggests a brush type so I would do trial and error with different kinds of brushes to try to get a similar look. Then I would try to soften the edges between colours but if you smug too much it\u2019s easy to lose texture and lighting.\\n\\n[Metal tutorial](https://www.deviantart.com/mateslaurentiu/art/Armor-tutorial-220805678) by [MatesLaurentiu](https://www.deviantart.com/mateslaurentiu/gallery)\\n\\n## Day 4 - Scales\\n\\nI was pretty excited for scales, thinking I would learn a technique to make 100 diamonds look good all at once. Turns out, no, you must draw every diamond.\\n\\nAt least if you want to do a shiny, impressive close up.\\n\\nThis study took the longest of the 5. The base approach of wavy lines on a column is very good for getting the shape down, but after that it\u2019s very much [\u201cdraw the rest of the owl\u201d](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/how-to-draw-an-owl) feeling.\\n\\n![](/img/wap/wap-27.4.jpg)\\n\\nI lined every scale, painting in the base colour, did one round of highlights, a second round of highlights, 2 rounds of shadows, then added more detail base colours somewhere in between. Went back and fixed the shadows because they needed to be blended. Went back and fixed the highlights because they needed to be blended. All those steps repeated for each scale.\\n\\nWhen I write it out it sounds terrible, but it can become relaxing. Once you know what you\u2019re trying to accomplish with the specific step you\u2019re on, it\u2019s easier to turn your brain off and just do it for a while. So I could see a huge scaled creature project being pretty fun. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s something I\u2019ll do often.\\n\\nScales tutorial by [Anastasia Deg aka AnastasiaBerry](https://www.youtube.com/c/Anastasiaberry)\\n\\n\\n## Day 5 - Fur\\n\\nI didn\u2019t love this fur tutorial at first glance but all the steps felt clear so I went with it. It wasn\u2019t until I started to read the instructions and follow along that I noticed that the shading part of the approach focused on hue shifting which is a technique I want to get better at (hue shifting is where you change the hue instead of something else like value or saturation).  This is a pretty good [guide to hue shifting](https://www.blue-canary.net/miniature-painting/painting-tips-and-guides/hue-shifting/).\\n\\nI wasn\u2019t able to get the exact colours they have in the guide but I\u2019m pretty happy with where my hues ended up. I feel like I lost some structure in the fur pieces but I think I understood the made shape takeaways that make the fur look dynamic.\\n\\n![](/img/wap/wap-27.5.jpg)\\n\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\n![](/img/wap/wap-27.6.jpg)\\n\\nThis was a very fun and refreshing week. It was nice to focus on small little studies that could be completed, while feeling like I\u2019m filling in some blanks in my brain. I\u2019m going to keep collecting guides like this and try to do another small studies week before the end of the year.\\n\\nPinterest board [link](https://ca.pinterest.com/maeanu3639/wap-materials/)."},{"id":"august-2024","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/august-2024","source":"@site/blog/2024-09-01.md","title":"1 Year of Altar Stone","description":"A look back on our first year of Altar Stone and some other art projects in August","date":"2024-09-01T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"art","permalink":"/blog/tags/art"},{"inline":true,"label":"altar-stone","permalink":"/blog/tags/altar-stone"}],"readingTime":6.005,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Kylie","title":"Admin","url":"https://github.com/kylies","imageURL":"https://github.com/kylies.png","key":"kylie","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"1 Year of Altar Stone","description":"A look back on our first year of Altar Stone and some other art projects in August","slug":"august-2024","authors":["kylie"],"tags":["art","altar-stone"],"Image":"/img/artwork/as-year1.png"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Weekly Art Practice - Week 27","permalink":"/blog/wap-27"},"nextItem":{"title":"Weekly Art Practice - Week 26","permalink":"/blog/wap-26"}},"content":"While I haven\u2019t been doing my weekly art practice while on vacation, there has still been a lot of projects on the go as well as our 1 year anniversary of [Altar Stone](https://www.youtube.com/@altarstone).\\n\\nI haven\u2019t posted all of the art I\u2019ve done for Altar Stone as it\u2019s split between multiple iPads and computers at this point. But the anniversary feels like a good time to put in the effort to gather them into a post.\\n\\nIt was also Drawclass week last week so I\u2019ll share my progress of trying to follow along to portrait painting.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## A year in review\\n\\nOur first Altar Stone video went up on August 23rd 2023. I believe I\u2019ve mentioned in the past that this was just going to be a static image until my wife took a shot at animating the sword in the octopus\u2019s arm. That launched the animation project that Altar Stone has become for me. We\u2019ve gone from PowerPoint, to multiple different animation apps to now learning the Godot game engine to try out different animation flows.\\n\\nIn the last year we\u2019ve published 13 videos, some of which reused assets as alternate themes of a song released. Putting us at a little more than 1 video per month. We both have art and music in the pipeline waiting to be paired so I\u2019d say our real total is closer to 15 videos.\\n\\n![Screenshot of our YouTube page showing 13 videos listed.](/img/yt-altarstone.png)\\n\\nWe\u2019ve been brainstorming ways to make Altar Stone into a product and have some ideas for the next year. We\u2019ve already started by adding some homebrew magic items paired to each song. We\u2019re going to wrap up Songs in the Key of Sea as our first album / completed playlist, and we\u2019ll start packaging that either on our own site or somewhere people can purchase it to have .mp3 versions of the songs to use outside of YouTube. Maybe we\u2019ll entertain the idea of commissioned work, but pricing a whole thing. We\u2019ve even [set up a Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/altarstone) for people to support the project, which was first motivated by people asking what to get us as wedding gifts, we encouraged them to support our project.\\n\\n![All the backgrounds I drew for Altar Stone videos so far.](/img/artwork/as-year1.png)\\n\\nFor my own artistic goals with the project, I\u2019m hoping to learn more Godot for the videos. Our first pixel art/Godot video got nearly 100 views in the first 24 hours, with us only sharing it with our friends. So the algorithm liked something about it to suggest it to other viewers. Easily the largest day 1 response we\u2019ve seen to a video. But I also feel like if I can get the fundamentals of Godot down I can create videos faster as it\u2019s often much easier than animating my ideas by hand.\\n\\nI\u2019m also considering doing some still backgrounds. I\u2019ve been learning a lot of animation for the last few months, which has led to practising different artistic skills. Non-animated backgrounds will give me a chance to play around with more ambitious paintings and scenes that are beyond my ability to animate in a month.\\n\\nSo one year into this project and it feels like we\u2019re still gathering steam. Last month we even started a Trello board to better track the pieces that are in the works. The 2nd year of Altar Stone should be an exciting one.\\n\\n## Latest Altar Stone release\\n\\nWe released a new Altar Stone video a few days ago. Sophie\u2019s approach to mermaid music as I had finished the art a few months before she started to work on the music so she had some imply direction already.\\n\\n<iframe width=\\"560\\" height=\\"315\\" src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/W79yyLzZiJY?si=cmvOW2l6ESJgtazw\\" title=\\"YouTube video player\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\\" referrerpolicy=\\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\\n\\nI\u2019m happy with a lot of this piece. I spent a lot of time trying to make a convincing stone texture on the walls and on the mermaid statue. Did some research into options for the water flowing from the pot and I feel like it sells really well for one of the simpler approaches to moving water. Feeling like the falling water, the drops, and the surface water wasn\u2019t enough for a scene I then added the little crab to practise some frame by frame animation (where you draw each iteration of the thing moving each frame).\\n\\n\\n## Portraits with Julia Drawclass\\n\\nThe monthly Drawfee Drawclass was portraits this month. I almost didn\u2019t attend because portraits have never been my thing and I was in the middle of making tater tots when the class started. But Sophie encouraged me to go sit down and I ended up enjoying it a lot.\\n\\nJulia covered some of the main things to keep in mind and how to approach a portrait, emphasising the importance of your sketch and having good, high quality reference photos. Julia was using a version of this still from Glass Onion and I Googled my own version for following along but suspect I didn\u2019t get a high quality one as I didn\u2019t want to spend too much time searching.\\n\\n![Screenshot of Benoit Blanc from Glass Onion, straight on face, half shadowed.](/img/bb-portrait-ref.jpg)\\n\\nThere wasn\u2019t enough time to get through the whole process, she covered all the blocking in and then started to blend/paint the skin. This is how far I got:\\n\\n![Day 1 progress.](/img/artwork/dc-portrait1.PNG)\\n\\nI\u2019m honestly surprised at how well it came together with just blending the blocks together, it\u2019s already starting to look like a face.\\n\\nI returned to it a little bit in the days after the class. We didn\u2019t cover eyes, hair, or lips during the class so I was afraid to get to those. First attempt on lips feels bad, first pass on hair also felt bad. To the point where I felt like I was starting to lose Daniel Craig\u2019s face. But the eyes! I feel like the eyes came out super well on the first try, not even taking that much time.\\n\\n![Daniel Craig portrait progress.](/img/artwork/dc-portrait2.jpg)\\n\\nThis went smoothly enough that I would consider doing other portraits from reference in the future. But I still don\u2019t feel like I know how to approach hair which will hold me back for a bit.\\n\\n## Art talk by Aleksander Rostov\\n\\nAleksander Rostov was the Art Director on Disco Elysium, a game that has some extremely beautiful and messed up art in it. His talk focuses on the piece of composition and design, going over how they are the pieces that you use, alter, change, or ignore, to create your own style. I had hoped he\u2019d spend some time talking about his personal workflow or how things came together in the game but the talk was fairly focused on understanding the board fundamentals. But Rostov is a pretty interesting speaker, so it made for an entertaining talk even when being familiar with the concepts.\\n\\n<iframe width=\\"560\\" height=\\"315\\" src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ByiwvWN4_NA?si=BCCyUxLRtS1Nr3j_\\" title=\\"YouTube video player\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\\" referrerpolicy=\\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\\n\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nNext week I\u2019m back to weekly art practice now that life is returning to a regular pace. But I\u2019m breaking from the classic format once again, this time to do a week of material / texture studies."},{"id":"wap-26","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/wap-26","source":"@site/blog/2024-08-18-week26.md","title":"Weekly Art Practice - Week 26","description":"Week 26 - Griffins","date":"2024-08-18T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"art","permalink":"/blog/tags/art"},{"inline":true,"label":"wap","permalink":"/blog/tags/wap"}],"readingTime":1.89,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Kylie","title":"Admin","url":"https://github.com/kylies","imageURL":"https://github.com/kylies.png","key":"kylie","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Weekly Art Practice - Week 26","description":"Week 26 - Griffins","slug":"wap-26","authors":["kylie"],"tags":["art","wap"],"Image":null},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"1 Year of Altar Stone","permalink":"/blog/august-2024"},"nextItem":{"title":"Weekly Art Practice - Week 25","permalink":"/blog/wap-25"}},"content":"This week is another fictional creature week. Started off pretty rough but came up with a good practice approach for a creature that doesn\u2019t exist.\\n\\n## Day 1 - Drawing from imagination\\n\\nDay 1 was rough. I\u2019m not really sure if I should put more time into the day one task as it doesn\u2019t feel like I\u2019m set up to learn anything yet.

Also want to keep learning some Godot stuff to see if I can get a nice setup together for getting things out faster. I have a new character and world tileset to play with from [Oryx Design Lab](https://www.oryxdesignlab.com/). Already have a space with a character moving around.

I also attended an animation course last weekend so I\u2019ll share some stuff from that, and I\u2019ve been working on a new Altar Stone video which was more technically demanding than art demanding for the last few weeks.\\n\\n## Day 1 - Drawing from imagination\\n\\nWhile I chose sparrows to continue on the most common animals in Montreal, it turns out I can only imagine them as basic small birds when not using a reference.\\n\\n![](/img/wap/wap-24.1.jpg)\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## Day 2 - Figure sketching\\n\\nWith a reference they still kind of look like a basic small bird, but then the colouration patterns really become important for identification.

I\u2019m not great at pixel aren\u2019t and I don\u2019t love it. Watching people making tiny pixel changes and getting a whole new character feels like magic to me. So I got the idea to look for open source assets instead of making my own.\\n\\nI also had a few ideas for the basic animation but while ideating on how I would approach it, it became clear that this would be something easier to do in a game engine than in an animation program. I had poked at Godot a few months ago out of curiosity at the 4.0 launch and the new Brackey video tutorial. So I understood some of the basic steps I knew I\u2019d have to do.\\n\\nIt turned out to be harder than I hoped to find good free assets. There are plenty out there but when you already have an idea in your head it\u2019s hard to accept the limited options. But I eventually chose a tileset, a cute bat for decorations, and some characters who don\u2019t look too ridiculous in the setting.\\n\\nAnd then I made the \u201clevel\u201d aka the walking course.\\n\\n![Screenshot of a pixel art platformer in Godot](/img/cave-level.png)\\n\\nI got the basics of moving the character around, controlling the camera and working with collision layers. Then needed my wife\u2019s help for follower logic code to execute the idea I had of \u201cadventurer party walking\u201d. Final product coming soon to the [Altar Stone YouTube channel!](https://www.youtube.com/@altarstone)\\n\\n## Animation class with Spencer Wan\\n\\nA few months ago I signed up to a [Spencer Wan](https://x.com/spencerwan) animation course focused on visual effects. Since effects, instead of full on character animations, is what I have been focusing on in my Alter Stone videos, I thought this course sounded like the perfect fit.\\n\\nIt ended up being 30C+ the day of the course. That\u2019s in the apartment even. So it was the most comfortable 4.5 hours to spend at a computer. But even just the first hour of the program felt enlightening. I did my notes in Clip Studio and then tried to follow the animations steps in SquidToon but the course moved pretty quickly due to time constraints (it was an ambitious agenda!) and only managed to complete the first lightning step by step:\\n\\n<img src={lightning} width=\\"500\\"/>\\n\\n### General notes\\n\\nOverall it was really great and I find myself trying to find Spencer\u2019s catalogue of work and video to see what else I can learn as he was great at breaking down concepts and approaches to very doable chunks.\\n\\n![Animation class notes p1.](/img/Spencer-p1.jpg)\\n\\n![Animation class notes p2.](/img/Spencer-p2.jpg)\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nIt was a big week for projects. I have a head full of animation ideas now and want to jump into some more big pieces to put them to use. Might get one more week of art in before I got on vacation for a week. It feels nice as I feel like I\'m having ideas for projects at a rate I can no longer keep up with. Nice to have the creative sparks and energy firing at the same time.\\n\\nPinterest board [of sparrows.](https://www.pinterest.ca/maeanu3639/wap-sparrow/)"},{"id":"wap-22-23","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/wap-22-23","source":"@site/blog/2024-07-29-week22-23.md","title":"Weekly Art Practice - Week 22 & 23","description":"Week 22 and 23","date":"2024-07-29T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"art","permalink":"/blog/tags/art"},{"inline":true,"label":"wap","permalink":"/blog/tags/wap"}],"readingTime":3.61,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Kylie","title":"Admin","url":"https://github.com/kylies","imageURL":"https://github.com/kylies.png","key":"kylie","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Weekly Art Practice - Week 22 & 23","description":"Week 22 and 23","slug":"wap-22-23","enableComments":true,"authors":["kylie"],"tags":["art","wap"],"Image":"/img/wap/wap-23.4.1.jpg"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Weekly Art Practice - Week 24","permalink":"/blog/wap-24"},"nextItem":{"title":"Weekly Art Practice - Week 21","permalink":"/blog/wap-21"}},"content":"I\u2019m a blog post behind in WAPs so I\'m going to cover the last two weeks in one.\\n\\nThe first week was an attempt at drawing myself. I\u2019ve wanted a self drawn avatar to use online my whole online life but I\u2019ve never managed to draw one I\u2019m happy enough with. And spoiler I still haven\u2019t.\\n\\nThe week after was skulls, which was a theme that was probably too broad. Lots of skull are very different from one another, so choosing something like Human Skulls probably would have given the week more focus.\\n\\n## Day 1 - Myself\\n\\nA few attempts at drawing myself without looking at myself.\\n\\n![](/img/wap/wap-22.1.jpg)\\n\\nStarting already a step behind one that I did earlier this year which I don\'t love.\\n\\n![](/img/wap/first-portrait.jpg)\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## Day 2 - Myself - Research\\n\\nFor day two I pulled up some general character art to try out some different styles of drawing faces. This turned out to be more difficult than I expected as it\u2019s not easy to just get a list of different looks so there was a lot of Pinterest.\\n\\n![Quick hand sketches using references](/img/wap/wap-22.2.jpg)\\n\\n## Day 3 - Myself - Reference studies\\n\\nOn day two I went through my phone and used old selfies as reference. I haven\u2019t taken many selfies in the last few years, it\u2019s a habit I\u2019m gotten out of. Partially out of a desire to have fewer photos of myself online and just wanting to take photos of cats and squirrels instead.\\n\\n![](/img/wap/wap-22.3.jpg)\\n\\n## Day 4 & 5 - Myself - Sketch progress\\n\\nI took another stab at sketching myself after my girlfriend voted for bowl cut with bangs as the most Me looking, look. One of the hardest things about trying to cartoonify myself is that I don\u2019t have a central feature to focus on. Hair is a big identifier for a cartoon and mine changes pretty drastically over 6 months, so even when I do have an avatar I like (Thanks Catarina [@radiantlethe](https://bsky.app/profile/radiantlethe.bsky.social) for previous avatars!) it\u2019s outdated extremely quickly. These days I have 2-3 pairs of glasses that I swap between and are all pretty different. And my face is very\u2026 average. Which I mean more in like, my forehead size is very average, not distinguishable, same thing about my nose. My lips are a little different due to surgery but that\u2019s not enough to make a face look like me. Square chin is maybe the strongest face shape feature that can be leaned on.\\n\\n![](/img/wap/wap-22.4.jpg)\\n\\nAnd then I took it digital. It\u2019s shocking how quickly sketches go from looking okay to looking ridiculous.\\n\\n![](/img/wap/wap-22.5.jpg)\\n\\n\\n## Day 1 - Skulls\\n\\nI thought I had a decent grasp on human skulls but putting pencil to paper really makes my brain want to stop imagining things clearly.\\n\\n![](/img/wap/wap-23.1.jpg)\\n\\n## Day 2 - Skulls\\n\\nSkulls were much easier with references but there are so many kinds and they\u2019re all pretty interesting. There seems to be a lot of interest in cat skulls so those come up a lot.\\n\\n![](/img/wap/wap-23.2.jpg)\\n\\n## Day 3 - Skulls\\n\\nDrawing more detailed skulls was fairly relaxing. There\u2019s a comfort in them being solid objects.\\n\\n![](/img/wap/wap-23.3.1.jpg)\\n\\n![](/img/wap/wap-23.3.2.jpg)\\n\\n## Day 4 - Skulls\\n\\n![](/img/wap/wap-23.4.1.jpg)\\n\\n![](/img/wap/wap-23.4.2.jpg)\\n\\n![](/img/wap/wap-23.4.3.jpg)\\n\\n## Day 5 - Skulls\\n\\nI get into a bit of a bird skull rut with the week. It felt easier than a lot of the other ones.\\n\\n![](/img/wap/wap-23.5.jpg)\\n\\n## End of Sketchbook 1\\n\\nLast year I bought a fresh sketchbook for carrying around, taking to the park and traveling and all that. This morning I used the last page! I picked this up while I was still trying to get into the swing of doing art more often. After a few years of barely drawing at all it felt like such a long shot to fill a new sketchbook.\\n\\nI\u2019m a notorious sticker hoarder so after getting this sketchbook I put every sticker I got across the course of the year on to it, which has made it into a nice little visual memory of a lot of activities.\\n\\n![](/img/wap/sketchbook1.jpg)\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nSo I had been hoping to end the week with a self portrait avatar I would use, but haven\u2019t. Skulls went pretty okay. And I bought a new sketchbook so it kind of feels like starting a new chapter.\\n\\nPinterest board [for skulls](https://www.pinterest.ca/maeanu3639/wap-skulls/)."},{"id":"wap-21","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/wap-21","source":"@site/blog/2024-07-15-week21.md","title":"Weekly Art Practice - Week 21","description":"Week","date":"2024-07-15T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"art","permalink":"/blog/tags/art"},{"inline":true,"label":"wap","permalink":"/blog/tags/wap"}],"readingTime":3.63,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Kylie","title":"Admin","url":"https://github.com/kylies","imageURL":"https://github.com/kylies.png","key":"kylie","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Weekly Art Practice - Week 21","description":"Week","slug":"wap-21","enableComments":true,"authors":["kylie"],"tags":["art","wap"],"Image":"/img/wap/wap-21.3.jpg"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Weekly Art Practice - Week 22 & 23","permalink":"/blog/wap-22-23"},"nextItem":{"title":"Weekly Art Practice - Week 20","permalink":"/blog/wap-20"}},"content":"I didn\u2019t complete my WAP exercises last week. It\u2019s my first time not getting through all 5 exercises but it was an anatomy week which often feel a little weird on the last two days. I hadn\u2019t even found any stylistic waltz references to use for day 4.\\n\\nBut it\u2019s not a lack of references that kept me away. I had a piece that, initially, was going to be rather simple but had turned into one of my most ambitious pieces yet (will share progress later in this post). One of the reasons I have such a structured practice schedule is that I haven\u2019t had many ideas for projects and these focused weeks help me to keep practising and creating even when my head is empty. So the idea that I\u2019m so taken with a new piece feels like my creativity is starting to stir again (it only took 1.5 years). So I\u2019m pretty happy to put weekly practice to the side if it means completing a full piece that I\u2019m excited about.\\n\\nBesides the new piece getting most of my creative attention, I\u2019ve been dealing with some pretty back upper back/neck pain. So while I want to spend multiple hours a day working on art I\u2019m having to take many breaks and also just limit the amount of time I spend with my head bent in hopes of not making the pain worse. And don\u2019t even get me started on how the current heat wave is completely sapping all my energy.\\n\\n\\n## Day 1 - Drawing from imagination\\n\\nOne of the reasons I chose waltz as a reference is that it\u2019s a fairly structured dance, almost stiff as dances go. But I also wanted to get into practising pieces with multiple characters where they are touching. Along with the challenge of having most of the pose hidden by a dress. Day 1 poses were rather simple from my brain.\\n\\n![](/img/wap/wap-21.1.jpg)\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## Day 2 - Figure sketching\\n\\nI still think I should be doing this exercise faster than I usually do. Especially with anatomy weeks as I should be trying to capture the movement flow or dynamics of a pose instead of trying to get it exactly right.\\n\\n![Quick hand sketches using references](/img/wap/wap-21.2.jpg)\\n\\n## Day 3 - Reference studies\\n\\nOnly did 2 pieces as I felt like since there are 2 people in each it\u2019s like doing 4 practices. This is where I really tried to problem solve the pose of the figure I can\u2019t see clearly. The nice part of waltz is that the two people are often moving in tandem so it means copying the more visible pose and applying it to the partner.\\n\\n![](/img/wap/wap-21.3.1.jpg)\\n\\n![](/img/wap/wap-21.3.2.jpg)\\n\\n## New Elden Ring Piece\\n\\nSo I shared a version of my Elden Ring character last week. Ever since the Shadow of the Erdtree DLC came out we\u2019ve been playing for at least 2 hours every day. It\u2019s a lot of Elden Ring. Because this was our main activity after our wedding we\u2019ve been joking that we honeymooned in the Shadow Realm (the new Elden Ring region). We have a collection of video game screenshots as a couple, Animal Crossing, Pokemon Sw/Sh, but we can\u2019t co-op in Elden Ring, so if I wanted our characters together I would have to do it myself.\\n\\n![](/img/artwork/er-honeymoon-base.jpg)\\n\\nI\u2019ll keep working on this for a few more days. I feel like I\u2019m in the final stages but the background is giving me a pretty hard time. I\u2019m struggling to balance the colours and details in a way that the background doesn\u2019t take away too much from the characters in the foreground, while also trying to not introduce too many colours to keep things balanced. But I keep finding a new thing about the image I don\u2019t love and then re-working it lol.\\n\\nI\u2019m hoping to focus on the last bit of lighting and shadows and then push the background \u201cfurther back\u201d so it doesn\u2019t steal attention. All while trying to not make the image too dark or muddied.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nGoing to spend a few more days on the Elden Ring Honeymoon piece and then try to get into my new WAP subject. But I also have a whole other Elden Ring piece idea which I know is going to try to claim all my attention.\\n\\nPinterest board [for waltz references.](https://www.pinterest.ca/maeanu3639/wap-waltz/)"},{"id":"wap-20","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/wap-20","source":"@site/blog/2024-07-05-week20.md","title":"Weekly Art Practice - Week 20","description":"Week 20 - Redraw","date":"2024-07-05T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"art","permalink":"/blog/tags/art"},{"inline":true,"label":"wap","permalink":"/blog/tags/wap"}],"readingTime":2.935,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Kylie","title":"Admin","url":"https://github.com/kylies","imageURL":"https://github.com/kylies.png","key":"kylie","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Weekly Art Practice - Week 20","description":"Week 20 - Redraw","slug":"wap-20","enableComments":true,"authors":["kylie"],"tags":["art","wap"],"Image":"/img/artwork/butterfly-princess-2006.jpg"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Weekly Art Practice - Week 21","permalink":"/blog/wap-21"},"nextItem":{"title":"One Week Character Challenge","permalink":"/blog/owc"}},"content":"Took a bit of an art break over the last two weeks while getting married. Still did some work on an [Altar Stone](https://www.youtube.com/@altarstone) animation and also drew my Elden Ring character as we\u2019re deep into the DLC.\\n\\n![Greyscale image of squatting Elden Ring character](/img/artwork/er-blorbo1.jpg)\\n\\nThis week kicked off more focused practice time and I\u2019m returning with:\\n1 - Focusing on a single piece for a week\\n2 - A childhood re-draw\\n\\n\\n## Day 1 - Pose\\n\\nHere\u2019s the original piece I started with.\\n\\n![](/img/artwork/butterfly-princess-2006.jpg)\\n\\nI can\u2019t remember any of the context for the design or composition. All I know is that this was done in pencil crayon and was likely one of my main pieces for art class when I was 17. So big into my Always Online internet years.\\n\\nI\u2019m following the workflow that was covered in the One Week Character program, so day 1 was mostly gathering reference, choosing a pose and getting the composition down.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n\\n## Day 2 - Outfit\\n\\nThe outfit was already established in the original but I made some minor changes to the wing designs to make them more easily recognizable as Butterfly. I deleted my sketch layers so I don\u2019t have a great image for this day. This is a screenshot of the video replay in Procreate.\\n\\n![](/img/wap/wap-20.2.jpg)\\n\\n## Day 3 - Colours\\n\\nI generated a palette from a monarch butterfly dress which gave me a good starting point.  I lightened the colour of the dress by a fair bit as I didn\u2019t want to work so heavily with black while also assuming I would end up darkening everything in the shading phase.\\n\\nI also changed the hair colour as the bright pink was just too random for me. Or at least 35 year old me.\\n\\n![](/img/wap/wap-20.3.jpg)\\n\\n## Day 4 & 5 - Shading and details\\n\\nI didn\u2019t take any inbetween screenshots of this process. I\u2019ve found a trick to how I approach shading. Often I don\u2019t go hard enough on my shadows so I figured out I could just duplicate my Multiply layer I was using and then the shadows really pop.\\n\\nI spent a rather long time on the magic circle, trying to make it look interesting. Then went hard on the rim lighting where the body is closest to the circle. Just a fair bit of experimental choices to try to make the circle pop will not pulling in all the attention by being too bright.\\n\\nSomething that was new for me was colouring in my black lines. I painted over them with an airbrush to bring them closer to their nearest colour and I feel like this does a nice job of smoothing things out. The place with the most black lines no longer draws in a lot of attention by being a place of high contrast. I\u2019ll try this out again in the future but maybe will commit to it harder instead of doing light airbrushing.\\n\\nI probably could have spent time adding more details and texture to the skin and the long part of the dress. I wrapped up the piece Thursday night as I was generally happy with it and didn\u2019t want to stress out my back muscles too much more by adding another day of fine tuning.\\n\\n![](/img/wap/wap-20.4.jpg)\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nGoing to make next week an anatomy week by drawing waltz poses. However I am a little worried that most references will have people in rather ornate outfits, making it difficult to see exact limb poses.\\n\\nPinterest board [for butterfly princess](https://www.pinterest.ca/maeanu3639/butterfly-redraw/)"},{"id":"owc","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/owc","source":"@site/blog/2024-06-16-owc.md","title":"One Week Character Challenge","description":"Designing a character in a week","date":"2024-06-16T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"art","permalink":"/blog/tags/art"}],"readingTime":4.19,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Kylie","title":"Admin","url":"https://github.com/kylies","imageURL":"https://github.com/kylies.png","key":"kylie","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"One Week Character Challenge","description":"Designing a character in a week","slug":"owc","enableComments":true,"authors":["kylie"],"tags":["art"],"Image":"/img/owc/OWC-Day2.jpg"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Weekly Art Practice - Week 20","permalink":"/blog/wap-20"},"nextItem":{"title":"Weekly Art Practice - Week 19","permalink":"/blog/wap-19"}},"content":"This week I took a break from my usual practice schedule to participate in [Paintables\u2019s One Week Character class](https://paintable.cc/one-week-character/). The students were provided with briefs to choose from and then focus on trying to work with that brief while following [David Belliveau\u2019s](https://davidbelliveau.com/) workflow. He did live videos from Monday to Friday covering each stage of the process and answering questions.\\n\\nIt\u2019s a good workflow overall, but I struggled to tune in to the sessions so did everything a day or two behind. There was a whole Discord community for it but I found it was too busy and messy, the way I often find Discord servers to be. But it was a good experience and it helped me stay focused on one piece for a whole week and be pretty happy with the end product.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## Day 1 - Figure drawing and finding a pose\\n\\nI wasn\u2019t hype on any of the five briefs that were provided, even by the time day one rolled around. I found them all to be extremely basic and straightforward character wise. This made it pretty difficult to get started, so I spent a good 20 minutes scrolling Pinterest while watching the first video.\\n\\nThe first thing I decided on was \u2018scythe\u2019. They\u2019d been on my mind since the launch of Arlecchino in Genshim Impact\u2026\\n\\nThis led to looking for poses of people holding poles that could have a blade added to the end of them. Ended up with this reference and this base figure. By this point Fallen Angel felt like the most logical choice from the briefs.\\n\\n![](/img/owc/OWC-Day1.jpg)\\n\\n## Day 2 - Clothing\\n\\nDay 2 focused on dressing the figure from day 1. I was pretty familiar with this step from last years courses and used parts of those approaches for this. Search for references and ideas then work with blocking in shapes to focus on balance on composition. I created 3 different ones during the course of the video for the day.\\n\\n![](/img/owc/OWC-Day2.jpg)\\n\\n## Day 3 - Colours\\n\\nThe video for day 3 started with linework so I felt behind instantly as I\u2019m still kind of stuck in having linework for a lot of my work. This day ended up taking a fair bit of time as I did a cleanup pass on the clothing, then a true linework layer after that. And then got around to trying out colours.\\n\\n![](/img/owc/OWC-Day3.jpg)\\n\\n## Day 4 - Details\\n\\nAnother thing that made the challenge more\u2026 challenging, was that colouring details other than clothing weren\u2019t covered until day 4. The main outfit detail I had was all the metal and honestly, I don\u2019t have too much experience with metal. I\u2019ve done a lot with flat greys but haven\u2019t done a lot of shading techniques. David\u2019s little tutorials were very helpful for how to approach these details. Choosing a reference and really focusing on it to learn a style to then apply to the parts of the character that require that. An exercise I\u2019ll try to fit into one of my practice weeks.\\n\\nA lot of this day was spent trying to develop how I wanted the metal to look. I don\u2019t love it but I started with the boots and I am pretty happy with the boots. I feel like they have the right amount of details.\\n\\n![](/img/owc/OWC-Day4.jpg)\\n\\n\\n## Day 5 - Finishing details\\n\\nThe stuff focused on day 5 was a lot of the stuff that I often skip over. Usually after I accomplish the stuff from day 4 I\u2019m feeling fairly over a piece. The big emphasis of the lessons over the week was to skip to a workflow. It helps to know which part to work on next and in which order. I found this very helpful in sticking with the piece for this long, even feeling like I was doing something different every day since each focus is a rather different creative challenge.\\n\\nThis day was re-doing the breastplate which I wasn\u2019t happy with, finishing up any textures I wanted to add and doubling down on the shadows and highlights.\\n\\n![](/img/owc/OWC-Day5.jpg)\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nI wasn\u2019t sure I was going to make it through this week. I didn\u2019t like the community aspect, I wasn\u2019t sure if I was going to learn anything different from the previous courses I had done, and I went to the movies when there was a chance the videos would be taken down and I wouldn\u2019t have a chance to watch the last one. But they ended up being still available Sunday morning and I was able to get my last details in then.\\n\\nIt feels good to finish a digital piece, and to not skip on the details. A lot does really come together in those last few stages. Given that this feels like a success I\u2019m thinking of changing up my practice schedule once again. Along with adding a week every month to focus on anatomy, I might also devote a week to completing a single piece to put my practice into place."},{"id":"wap-19","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/wap-19","source":"@site/blog/2024-06-08-week19.md","title":"Weekly Art Practice - Week 19","description":"Week","date":"2024-06-08T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"art","permalink":"/blog/tags/art"},{"inline":true,"label":"wap","permalink":"/blog/tags/wap"}],"readingTime":1.26,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Kylie","title":"Admin","url":"https://github.com/kylies","imageURL":"https://github.com/kylies.png","key":"kylie","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Weekly Art Practice - Week 19","description":"Week","slug":"wap-19","enableComments":true,"authors":["kylie"],"tags":["art","wap"],"Image":"/img/wap/wap-19.3.1.jpg"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"One Week Character Challenge","permalink":"/blog/owc"},"nextItem":{"title":"Weekly Art Practice - Week 18","permalink":"/blog/wap-18"}},"content":"This week\'s theme is chameleons, another creature I\u2019ve always loved.

A common practice method I\u2019ve been wanting to do more is to try from movie stills. Movies are heavily invested in lighting and composition so learning from movies you like is a good way to learn.\\n\\nI did direct colour picks from this still from The Fall, one of my favourite movies. The whole movie is rather muted but the characters themselves often have a very vibrant colour as part of their outfit. I really like this bright red and gold outfit in this scene of beautiful stucco structures. Next time I\u2019ll try choosing the colours manually instead of colour picking them with the eye drop tool to see if I can guess the colours because when using the eye drop I\u2019m often surprised by how much darker or lighter a colour is once I see it on the colour wheel.\\n\\n![](/img/artwork/fall-colours1.jpg)\\n\\n[Volleyball](https://www.pinterest.ca/maeanu3639/wap-vollyball/) Pinterest board."},{"id":"wap-16","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/wap-16","source":"@site/blog/2024-05-21-week16.md","title":"Weekly Art Practice - Week 16","description":"Week","date":"2024-05-21T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"art","permalink":"/blog/tags/art"},{"inline":true,"label":"wap","permalink":"/blog/tags/wap"}],"readingTime":1.645,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Kylie","title":"Admin","url":"https://github.com/kylies","imageURL":"https://github.com/kylies.png","key":"kylie","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Weekly Art Practice - Week 16","description":"Week","slug":"wap-16","enableComments":true,"authors":["kylie"],"tags":["art","wap"],"Image":"/img/wap/wap-16.2.jpg"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Weekly Art Practice - Week 17","permalink":"/blog/wap-17"},"nextItem":{"title":"Weekly Art Practice - Week 15","permalink":"/blog/wap-15"}},"content":"This week I went for hyenas.

For references I went with figure skaters as they do some pretty weird stuff with their body that you don\u2019t see people doing in other situations.\\n\\nWhich, surprise surprise, does make it more difficult.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## Day 1 - Drawing from imagination\\n\\nI enjoyed watching figure skating when I had cable. But not enough to go out of my way to watch it now. So my memories of the movements are a little rusty going into day 1.\\n\\n![](/img/wap/wap-13.1.jpg)\\n\\n\\n## Day 2 - Figure sketching\\n\\nCompetitive figure skating is highly photographed so there is an endless supply of reference photos for the sport. However as I started to gather references I did come to realise that Yuri on Ice has taken over a large part of figure skating fandom, especially the art side.\\n\\n![Quick sketches using references](/img/wap/wap-13.2.jpg)\\n\\n## Day 3 - Reference studies\\n\\nSince I\u2019m more focused on the body and not so much the whole scene of figure skating I did only want to focus on the physical pose for my reference studies. So this meant no drawing fancy figure skating outfits or hair styles.\\n\\n![](/img/wap/wap-13.3.1.jpg)\\n\\n![](/img/wap/wap-13.3.2.jpg)\\n\\nBy this day I was thinking that I should pull up some lessons on different figure drawing approaches. Some people have some lovely styled ways of doing figure drawing while others have some extremely detailed shapes that they use to really analyse the pose. My own approach is a bit of a mishmash of the styles I learned last year which I don\u2019t feel like is either super stylized or super accurate. So in my next anatomy focused week I think I want to find a more refined approach.\\n\\n\\n## Day 4 - Style studies\\n\\nTrying to find art of figure skaters is where the Yuri on Ice characters dominate. I didn\u2019t want to pull directly from anime which led to having to restrict my choices a bit. I found someone else basically doing the thing I\u2019m trying to do, figure skater pose sketches:\\n\\n![](/img/wap/wap-13.4.1.jpg)\\n\\nReference: [By WildSword on DeviantArt.

This maybe gives some advantage to day 5, even just on the level of being warmed up before starting.\\n\\nInstead of doing multiple takes I decided to take the first pose that came to mind and went through a few fixing stages. Extend a few limbs, keep having to make the head bigger. Just fixes to try to get the anatomy closer and closer to correct.\\n\\n![](/img/wap/wap-13.5.jpg)\\n\\n\\n## Water colours\\n\\nWhile I was procrastinating on doing my studies I did a watercolor practice instead. I save Youtube tutorials as they pop up if they look interesting and within my skill level so this is the one I followed this week.\\n\\n<iframe width=\\"560\\" height=\\"315\\" src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/NjuMrThyWU8?si=NODYS9sZN7zVAlZt\\" title=\\"YouTube video player\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\\" referrerpolicy=\\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\\n\\nThis took about 30 minutes which made for a nice quick dip back into watercolours. I haven\u2019t touched them much since last summer, it just doesn\u2019t feel like a winter medium for art.\\n\\n![](/img/wc-hydrangea.jpg)\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nI kind of regret choosing figure skaters as my subject matter for my first anatomy week. They have so many weird poses and there is constant foreshortening or hidden parts of the body in the photos. My girlfriend says this makes for a good challenge but it definitely led to me dragging my feet on doing simple studies because of how messed up looking they were coming out.\\n\\nBut I do think it sets a good benchmark. If I was a master of anatomy I would be able to piece together what the body is doing in the areas I can\u2019t see. I didn\u2019t feel super confident in the guesses I made in these but it will be a good sign of improvement later on when I feel like I can make those conclusions.\\n\\n[Figure skating Pinterest board.](https://www.pinterest.ca/maeanu3639/wap-figureskating/)"},{"id":"wap-12","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/wap-12","source":"@site/blog/2024-04-20-week12.md","title":"Weekly Art Practice - Week 12","description":"Week 12 - Giant anteater","date":"2024-04-20T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"art","permalink":"/blog/tags/art"},{"inline":true,"label":"wap","permalink":"/blog/tags/wap"}],"readingTime":3.64,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Kylie","title":"Admin","url":"https://github.com/kylies","imageURL":"https://github.com/kylies.png","key":"kylie","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Weekly Art Practice - Week 12","description":"Week 12 - Giant anteater","slug":"wap-12","enableComments":true,"authors":["kylie"],"tags":["art","wap"],"Image":"/img/wap/wap-12.1.jpg"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Weekly Art Practice - Week 13","permalink":"/blog/wap-13"},"nextItem":{"title":"Weekly Art Practice - Week 11","permalink":"/blog/wap-11"}},"content":"As mentioned in my last WAP, I\u2019ve made a return to creature drawing to have some easier WAP weeks.

It wasn\u2019t until day 5 that I learnt that giant anteaters walk on their knuckles (like gorillas) to protect their very sharp and huge front claws.\\n\\nAlso learned that they fight back against jaguars by using those large claws and standing up on their back legs, using their huge tail as a kind of tripod support to stay upright. So I tried drawing this upright position even though I never saw an image of them taking this pose.\\n\\n![](/img/wap/wap-12.5.jpg)\\n\\n\\n## Blind study method\\n\\nEvery now and then YouTube will recommend a decent art tutorial video. I\u2019m always on the hunt for things like guided practice and different ways to study so this one got my attention.\\n\\n<iframe width=\\"560\\" height=\\"315\\" src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/AB9yTNfE3go?si=9xy_U650xEzygCeK\\" title=\\"YouTube video player\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\\" referrerpolicy=\\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\\n\\nI liked the sound of this approach because it\u2019s similar to how I would practise for exams. Making flash cards, going through the movements of questions and answers. I also liked the idea of giving yourself just an hour to do it.\\n\\nMy study subject for my first attempt is this [drow piece by Anna Siwo\u0144](https://www.artstation.com/artwork/GGNw4). I like the grumpy expression so that\u2019s what I wanted to focus on.\\n\\nThe idea is to first draw the image while looking at it. Then take the reference away and try to do it again. Make corrections, spot where you went wrong. Then hide the reference again and try again.\\n\\n![](/img/blindstudy1.jpg)\\n\\n![](/img/blindstudy2.jpg)\\n\\n![](/img/blindstudy3.jpg)\\n\\nI honestly felt like I was getting worse and worse as the attempts went on. So I\u2019m not sure how I feel about this just yet. I should probably try with either a smaller focus or on something more generic. I\u2019m not sure yet.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nI felt like I got a decent amount of practice time in this week. The anteaters didn\u2019t take very long each day. Finally feels like getting back in the grove after Renpy month. Main downside being that anteaters are so unique and weird I\u2019m not sure when learning their shape is going to be helpful again. Maybe in monster creation or something like that.\\n\\nI hope to try to blind practice method again but I\u2019m having my doubts. There are other approaches for learning other artists styles which I might try out instead. Compare the methods and see which one works best for me.\\n\\n[Giant anteater Pinterest board.](https://www.pinterest.ca/maeanu3639/wap-anteater/)"},{"id":"wap-11","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/wap-11","source":"@site/blog/2024-04-15-week11.md","title":"Weekly Art Practice - Week 11","description":"Week 10 - Books and shelves","date":"2024-04-15T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"art","permalink":"/blog/tags/art"},{"inline":true,"label":"wap","permalink":"/blog/tags/wap"}],"readingTime":3.095,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Kylie","title":"Admin","url":"https://github.com/kylies","imageURL":"https://github.com/kylies.png","key":"kylie","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Weekly Art Practice - Week 11","description":"Week 10 - Books and shelves","slug":"wap-11","enableComments":true,"authors":["kylie"],"tags":["art","wap"],"Image":"/img/wap/wap-11.2.jpg"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Weekly Art Practice - Week 12","permalink":"/blog/wap-12"},"nextItem":{"title":"Weekly Art Practice - Week 10","permalink":"/blog/wap-10"}},"content":"This was a messy WAP week. [Dana](https://www.danarama.ca/Blog/) suggested fancy books so I gave that a shot, but turns out inanimate objects just aren\u2019t that interesting. Reminding me why I so rarely do still life pieces.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## Day 1 - Drawing from imagination\\n\\nWhen it comes down to it, books are just squares. So it was pretty easy to quickly draw some squares.\\n\\n![](/img/wap/wap-11.1.jpg)\\n\\n\\n## Day 2 - Figure sketching\\n\\nOn day 2 I started to recognize an early hangup of this subject. Since books are basically just squares I\u2019d much rather draw them digitally using square or line making tools for consistency. But doing any sort of intricate design on the cover, something that\u2019s often requiring small, repetitive motions, is something I\u2019d rather do with traditional media. I wanted to get better at drawing straight lines so I didn\u2019t even end up letting myself use the square or line tools for day 2. So these came out rather messy and not detailed.\\n\\n![Quick sketches using references](/img/wap/wap-11.2.jpg)\\n\\n## Day 3 - Reference studies\\n\\nTried to force myself into doing more time on these but I just don\u2019t have the patience for doing detailed designs. So I swapped to doing more book themed scenes. Which are more engaging but the idea of drawing 100 books in a scene is a really big turn off.\\n\\n![](/img/wap/wap-11.3.jpg)\\n\\nI ended up spending more time trying to find a brush that would give me irregular squares to quickly fill shelves. I didn\u2019t find exactly what I wanted in Clip Studio so kind of just moved on.\\n\\n## Day 4 - Style studies\\n\\nFor the style study I decided to do a scene study. Just wanted to try blocking in the shapes and creating a scene. I\u2019m once again worried that this might be an AI piece, the one clue being \u201cwtf is up with these hanging lights? Are they inside or outside? Is that pumpkin on the right attached to the tree?\u201d\\n\\n![](/img/wap/wap-11.4.jpg)\\n\\nI was actually kind of happy with the stylized look of the building in the end, but got tired by the time I should start filling out the inside of the building so I just rushed through with the bare minimum.\\n\\nReference: [Couldn\u2019t find the original source, so just on Pinterest.](https://www.pinterest.ca/pin/598978819223999743/)\\n\\n\\n## Day 5 - Drawing from imagination\\n\\nI really wasn\u2019t sure what to do for drawing from imagination day since I struggled to find any main take away lessons from the practice days. I decided to go for drawing the bookshelf that was next to me. Which happens to actually not be many books.\\n\\n![](/img/wap/wap-11.5.jpg)\\n\\nIt was still pretty painful to draw the books that were there. Was mostly hype about doing the skull. I was originally going to go into more details but the weekend quickly disappeared so just tried to push through to get the space filled.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nAnother week I didn\u2019t find particularly inspiring. Trying to do too much and too little at the same time.\\n\\nI\u2019m probably going to go back to animals for a bit to re-find my groove with these weekly practices. Then every few weeks I\u2019m going to try to focus on human anatomy and movement since I know it\u2019s such a key area if I want to get comfortable drawing characters again.\\n\\nThis week I also found a YouTube video explaining a blind study method for art that got my attention because it\u2019s similar to how I would study for school. It\u2019s a practice that you should put at least an hour aside to do so I\u2019m going to try to find time to do it at least once next week between whatever animal I end up choosing.\\n\\n[Books Pinterest board.](https://www.pinterest.ca/maeanu3639/wap-books/)"},{"id":"wap-10","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/wap-10","source":"@site/blog/2024-04-07-week10-wap.md","title":"Weekly Art Practice - Week 10","description":"Week 10 - Sword swing","date":"2024-04-07T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"art","permalink":"/blog/tags/art"},{"inline":true,"label":"wap","permalink":"/blog/tags/wap"}],"readingTime":3.325,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Kylie","title":"Admin","url":"https://github.com/kylies","imageURL":"https://github.com/kylies.png","key":"kylie","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Weekly Art Practice - Week 10","description":"Week 10 - Sword swing","slug":"wap-10","enableComments":true,"authors":["kylie"],"tags":["art","wap"],"Image":null},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Weekly Art Practice - Week 11","permalink":"/blog/wap-11"},"nextItem":{"title":"March 2024 wrap-up","permalink":"/blog/march-wrap-up"}},"content":"WAP is back.\\n\\nIt was hard to get back into this practice style after a month away. I kind of forgot the physical steps of it and had to remind myself of what the days were for. Maybe it didn\u2019t help that my returning subject was a more difficult one: Swinging swords.\\n\\nI had wanted to do something a little more dynamic pose wise. But it one where anatomy is so important that without a really good grasp of the photo body references, doing style studies feels extra challenging as I\u2019m not 100% sure what\u2019s correct.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## Day 1 - Drawing from imagination\\n\\nFeeling rusty that\u2019s for sure. Dynamic poses without a reference are up there on the difficulty scale so there are just so many bad proportions here. I was feeling pretty done with it after just doing 3 half bodies but I think pushing myself to fill the page helped a lot to go beyond my comfort zone.\\n\\n![](/img/wap/wap-10.1.jpg)\\n\\n\\n## Day 2 - Figure sketching\\n\\nI ended up doing way more pages of day 2 than usual. I have wanted to up the speed in which these speed studies are done and I found that action poses take up a fair bit of room on the page.\\n\\n![Quick sketches using references](/img/wap/wap-10.2.1.jpg)\\n![Quick sketches using references](/img/wap/wap-10.2.2.jpg)\\n![Quick sketches using references](/img/wap/wap-10.2.3.jpg)\\n\\nIt was harder than I thought it would be to find photographs of sword fighting action. Lots of fencing, some historical style with samurai swords, but not too much else. Found one or two shots of actors learning some choreography, but definitely expected more LARP-like content. But I also was trying to focus on what looked professional so that the people in the photos had proper form. But given I don\u2019t know what proper form looks like it\u2019s not something I should realistically be trying to judge.\\n\\n## Day 3 - Reference studies\\n\\nWhile working on these I started to consider a good practice approach to be choosing one pose and trying to draw it from multiple angles. Just to pursue trying to understand the pose and not just ignoring anything that the limbs or the weapon hide from view. I didn\u2019t end up doing that because I wanted to try out a variety of poses. But if I revisit the subject I might give it a shot.\\n\\n![](/img/wap/wap-10.3.jpg)\\n\\n\\n## Day 4 - Style studies\\n\\n![](/img/wap/wap-10.4.1.jpg)\\n\\nReference: Link which I believe is from one of the original Legend of Zelda guide books.\\n\\nReference: [By kaysd999 on Twitter](https://twitter.com/kaysd999/status/896068014071611393)\\n\\n![](/img/wap/wap-10.4.2.jpg)\\n\\nReference: Screenshot from the anime, Solo Leveling\\n\\nReference: [Random Swings by NEIGHBORSTUDIOS on DeviantArt](https://www.deviantart.com/neighborstudios/art/Random-swings-474037356)\\n\\nI didn\u2019t feel like I had any really solid discoveries or moments of enlightenment from working from this style studies. A lot comes back to having a good grasp of anatomy and understanding how the body moves. I didn\u2019t notice that one of the arms in the Solo Leveling reference was pretty messed up which then made me question the pose overall. But given that it\u2019s a screenshot it\u2019s not like it\u2019s an image that was meant to be overly scrutinised. What seems more important is being able to \u201csell\u201d the movement.  \\n\\n## Day 5 - Drawing from imagination\\n\\nI possibly made the mistake of waiting 3 days to do the final test day. Felt like the knowledge had already left my head.\\n\\n![](/img/wap/wap-10.5.jpg)\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nI can\u2019t say I loved this week. It was difficult and nothing was really coming out as I hoped. It\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve done a full body pose and it shows. Really thinking that what I should be doing is spending a week every month on figure drawing just to get confident in human bodies again.\\n\\nIf I can find some good references I\u2019d like to try again as weapon poses are very much what I\u2019d like to be doing with D&D art but it feels like there are lots of pieces to master before pulling off dynamic poses.\\n\\n[Sword swinging Pinterest board.](https://www.pinterest.ca/3bf3339d7af2759ce0c142f671fac3/wap-sword-swing/)"},{"id":"march-wrap-up","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/march-wrap-up","source":"@site/blog/2024-03-29-march-wrapup.md","title":"March 2024 wrap-up","description":"Final Renpy progress and other works","date":"2024-03-29T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"art","permalink":"/blog/tags/art"}],"readingTime":4.055,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Kylie","title":"Admin","url":"https://github.com/kylies","imageURL":"https://github.com/kylies.png","key":"kylie","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"March 2024 wrap-up","description":"Final Renpy progress and other works","slug":"march-wrap-up","enableComments":true,"authors":["kylie"],"tags":["art"],"Image":"/img/staglight/sl-fisherman.png"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Weekly Art Practice - Week 10","permalink":"/blog/wap-10"},"nextItem":{"title":"NaNoRenO - Week 2","permalink":"/blog/nanoreno2"}},"content":"My approach to March was to put my Weekly Art Practice on hold while participating in NaNoRenO in an attempt to really push my art skills into focusing on scenes and backgrounds. I felt like I started off pretty strong on this mission but at this point in the month I know it\u2019s not gonna happen.\\n\\n## NaNoRenO\\n\\nWhile I spat out over 8 different backgrounds in 2 weeks, when I went to switch into writing mode I wasn\u2019t really feeling the project any more. I have most of the ideas fleshed out but I don\u2019t love it. I also don\u2019t get the same creative hit from writing as I do from working on visual art.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\nI did enjoy troubleshooting the Ren\u2019py setup though. I was able to get randomised scene selection working with modatory scenes in between. If I were to do the project again I would probably try to team up with a writer instead of trying to tackle it all on my own. For this project my girlfriend says she\u2019s tempted to take a shot at doing the writing so maybe it will turn into a game in the end.\\n\\nOne thing I learned about taking on a month-long project was that it was a great way to trigger my procrastination instincts. I finished 2 whole games this month, one of which I had been putting off for ages. The Return of Obra Dinn (which only took 2 days) and Tears of the Kingdom, which it turns out I was only about 15 hours from the end when I put it down months ago. So now I know that if I want to finish some other things all I need to do is give myself a big project to avoid.\\n\\nI did do one last piece for the project last week. The only character who makes an appearance, a fisherman who stops by the lighthouse to give the main character supplies.\\n\\n![A fisherman wearing blue-grey overalls, a beige sweater and a green knit hat.](/img/staglight/sl-fisherman.png)\\n\\nThe vibe for the game that I wanted to aim for was everything seems to be fine, this is like learning what a day in the life of a lighthouse keeper is. But with a pretty quick reveal that something isn\u2019t right. Minor hints of this were going to be added to the background pieces but I think there\u2019s only one visible now. This led to the choice to keep the kind of dead, beady eyes my fisherman sketch had in the final product. I wanted him to also look a little off.\\n\\nAll in all the first two weeks were a great crash course in doing completed scenes. But I quickly started to miss my weekly art practice. Having clear goals every day really helps with focus and a sense of accomplishment. The variety and change up every week helps too, so it felt almost odd to focus on a single project for a whole month.\\n\\n\\n## A different kind of scene\\n\\nSince I kind of \u201cran out\u201d of pieces to work on for the Ren\'py project but didn\u2019t want to resume weekly art practice yet I started a new, very large piece. It\u2019s not large in pixels but it does feel large in ambition. This is what I have so far:\\n\\n![A 3 story pink stone building. Two balconies above a shop front that hasn\u2019t been drawn in yet.](/img/artwork/dragon-flowers-wip.jpg)\\n\\nMy Ren\u2019py work did make me more comfortable with scenes and trying out new styles. I wanted to work on something similar but with references that would help a scene be recognizable. A challenge to make a piece that could still resemble the references. So this is a representation of Dragon Flowers, a famous Montreal flower shop. Or at least it\u2019s old location. The store has had a rough few years.\\n\\nI started with the upper balconies, trying to focus on smaller segments to not feel too overwhelmed. Dragon Flowers always has a lot of stuff outside the shop, and I honestly find it rather chaotic. But it\u2019s what makes it an interesting challenge. My goal will be to work on it when I still feel like drawing after doing my daily WAP goals.\\n\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nWhile I\u2019m not ending the month with a completed game as I had planned, the amount of time I spent in Clip Studio, trying out new brushes, doing research into lighting and scenes did lead to a lot of learning. I actually even enjoyed working on all the scenes. I do still wish I could find a consistent style (I\u2019m constantly agonising over what kind of brush I should use for inking, how big should it be???). But overall I don\u2019t think the pieces I did this month vary too wildly from one another.\\n\\nNext month I\u2019m going to get back into regular practice and blogging."},{"id":"nanoreno2","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/nanoreno2","source":"@site/blog/2024-03-16-nanoreno2.md","title":"NaNoRenO - Week 2","description":"Week 2 progress overview","date":"2024-03-16T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"art","permalink":"/blog/tags/art"}],"readingTime":2.25,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Kylie","title":"Admin","url":"https://github.com/kylies","imageURL":"https://github.com/kylies.png","key":"kylie","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"NaNoRenO - Week 2","description":"Week 2 progress overview","slug":"nanoreno2","enableComments":true,"authors":["kylie"],"tags":["art"],"Image":"/img/staglight/sl-storm.jpg"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"March 2024 wrap-up","permalink":"/blog/march-wrap-up"},"nextItem":{"title":"NaNoRenO - Week 1","permalink":"/blog/nanoreno1"}},"content":"Week 2 has been a rather slow one.

So we\u2019re in challenging times!\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## Backgrounds\\n\\nWhile I only did two backgrounds this week I am rather happy with them. The first was this big storm scene. I did some research into painting storm clouds and then also into waves (which I often find difficult). The lightning looks rather unnatural due to being from a lightning brush but I kind of like how much it stands out as it is the focus of the pieces.\\n\\n![Top of a lighthouse looking out at rough waves. A large bolt of lightning moves between storm clouds.](/img/staglight/sl-storm-bg.jpg)\\n\\nThe second background has a lot of simple cheats for doing woodsy backdrops but it takes a lot of time to fill all the layers this kind of piece needs. So I spent two evenings chipping away at this one. But I feel like the shading does pull things together and convey depth in the scene. I could probably make it even stronger by doing more obvious lighting but I was starting to feel like I needed to move on\u2026 to resting on the couch and watching tv.\\n\\n![Stag on a path in the woods.](/img/staglight/sl-forest-bg.jpg)\\n\\n## Website update\\n\\nThis is such a small website change that I suspect no one would notice unless I point it out.

It\u2019s now this guy, which was an attempt at making a 16x16px squirrel for a possible GameBoy game but I think it looks a little more dog-like?

This will definitely contain spoilers, I guess?? But also the game is completely in flux so who knows what a real spoiler is.\\n\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## Ren\u2019py\\n\\nMy biggest game \u201cmechanic\u201d that I wanted to be able to incorporate was randomising the order of scenes a player could get. It ended up being easy enough to find other people asking for example how to do this. So I took some code samples shared in a forum and started to experiment with how to use it. So far so good, now I just need to not get lost in it while filling in the content.\\n\\nSomething I don\u2019t love about Ren\u2019py is that it seems like the bulk of the game is in a single file. It will probably make it easier to hunt for errors in the future but I\u2019m very worried about how messy the file will get.\\n\\n## Backgrounds\\n\\nMy main focus for the week was backgrounds. With the second day being troubleshooting why my image isn\'t filling the screen properly. Spent a fair bit of time researching why this could happen only to finally find that it was my own Clip Studio Paint save setting that was re-sizing the output. Oops. Which is why at the end of day one this was all the progress I had to show.\\n\\n![Quick sketches using references](/img/staglight/day1.png)\\n\\nWith that solved I spent each day trying to complete one background. As of today I have 6, having taken 2 days easy after longer work days. So I\u2019m pretty happy about that. It\u2019s nearly 50% of the backgrounds I had planned for.\\n\\n![A collection of 5 background images.](/img/staglight/week1-bgs.jpg)\\n\\n## Planning\\n\\nI had done my original game flow layout before the month started (which you are allowed to do!). I had originally planned to make the first prototype of this game in Twine so I had that downloaded and ready to go. I\u2019m more familiar with Twine so I used it to lay down the main beats/scenes as well as the progression path. Which resulted in this:\\n\\n![Screenshot of Twine boxes](/img/staglight/scene-flow.png)\\n\\nThis is what helped me count how many backgrounds I would need and how many scenes I would have to write.\\n\\nI\u2019ve only written a few lines so far, I should really start getting other ideas down. But I have confidence in my writing speed and less confidence in my drawing speed so the creation of the assets is my biggest priority while I still have new project excitement.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nI do feel my desire for drawing backgrounds already waning. But buying new brushes and finding ways to \u201ccheat\u201d a look I want to do still feels nice. In some places, like the fence in the garden scene, I tried to find a fence brush that would help me spit that out in a second. But after trying 3 or 4 I gave up and drew one segment then repeated it. For the ropes in the outdoor lighthouse scene that was an easy brush to find so I could just do 2 lines then done. So there is a bit of a treasure hunt quality to some of the tasks which I enjoy. Found a water reflection brush that I feel like works really well so I\u2019m no longer afraid to fill the space on large bodies of water.\\n\\nThe indoor scenes though, yikes.\\n\\nI did a fair bit of research into lighthouses before I started (and still am really). But there are very few images of the inside of lighthouses. And these days when you try to research them, what you\u2019re going to find is remodelled lighthouses turned into Air B&Bs. Which is very much not what I\u2019m looking for.\\n\\nSo with indoor scenes being a weakness and having basically zero reference images to work from, I\u2019m afraid these rooms are going to look rather wild as I continue to draw more of them. I\u2019m proud of the desk scene at least. That\u2019s the first image in the game so I wanted to at least not hate it. While a few of the backgrounds I\u2019ve done I do hate already. But we only have a month so can\u2019t dwell on trying to fix them, it\u2019s on to the next image."},{"id":"wap-9","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/wap-9","source":"@site/blog/2024-03-01-week9-wap.md","title":"Weekly Art Practice - Week 9","description":"Week 9 - Trees","date":"2024-03-01T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"art","permalink":"/blog/tags/art"},{"inline":true,"label":"wap","permalink":"/blog/tags/wap"}],"readingTime":3.675,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Kylie","title":"Admin","url":"https://github.com/kylies","imageURL":"https://github.com/kylies.png","key":"kylie","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Weekly Art Practice - Week 9","description":"Week 9 - Trees","slug":"wap-9","enableComments":true,"authors":["kylie"],"tags":["art","wap"],"Image":"/img/wap/wap-9.5.jpg"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"NaNoRenO - Week 1","permalink":"/blog/nanoreno1"},"nextItem":{"title":"Weekly Art Practice - Week 8","permalink":"/blog/wap-8"}},"content":"Spending a week on trees is kind of a weird one.

It\u2019s easy to think of triangle pin trees, or apple trees that are mostly just a green circle for the leaves and then a trunk. Trying to be realistic mostly feels like drawing leaves and branches until you get tired of it.\\n\\n![](/img/wap/wap-9.1.jpg)\\n\\nI did take a stab at some non-local tree types that were in my head from preparing my reference photos the day before. There are some very interesting trees out there.\\n\\n## Day 2 - Figure sketching\\n\\nTried to make myself speed up for figure sketching this week. It worked for the first three, mostly just laying down shapes. After that I spent more time thinking about the smaller parts of the tree and wanting to give them more detail as the first 3 felt like messy blobs.\\n\\n![Quick sketches using references](/img/wap/wap-9.2.jpg)\\n\\n## Day 3 - Reference studies\\n\\nIt was a little strange to do reference studies since I know my goal for the end of the week isn\u2019t to replicate trees exactly. At this point I started to play around with brushes to lay down leaves faster, using the reference mostly for shape.\\n\\n![](/img/wap/wap-9.3.jpg)\\n\\nI did multiple pine trees because I knew I\u2019d be drawing a lot of them in March. These were pretty simple in that I just tried out 3 different brushes to act as the pine needles. Then on the more detailed one I just tried hand drawing a bunch of branches. Which didn\u2019t actually take too long in the end.\\n\\n## Day 4 - Style studies\\n\\nThere were a lot of different styles I wanted to spend time on but it could have been a project for the whole week. First I tried some of the vector styles that I had tried a bit when doing lighthouses & landscape week. And then a more cartoon-y style that I like a lot for it\u2019s flow.\\n\\n![](/img/wap/wap-9.4.1.jpg)\\n\\nReference: [Vector trees](https://toffu.co/en-ca/products/flat-vector-exterior-plants?variant=36707881386151)  & [cartoon trees](https://www.artstation.com/artwork/Yee3x6)\\n\\nThen I tried for some watercolours but remembered the watercolour brushes I like are on Procreate and not in Clip. So I don\u2019t feel like I was able to really re-create the right style there. But I like the originals and may pursue them on paper someday.\\n\\n![](/img/wap/wap-9.4.2.jpg)\\n\\nReference: [Watercolour trees by Olga Sokal](https://olasokal.tumblr.com/post/79829164773/nature-designs)\\n\\nThen I wanted to do a more painterly one. I liked how blocky this one was and used some new square brushes that I was finally able to find. Pretty happy with this vibe but don\u2019t feel like it\u2019s a great fit for trying to draw a whole forest.\\n\\n![](/img/wap/wap-9.4.3.jpg)\\n\\nReference: [Painted tree by \u767d\u672f](https://www.artstation.com/artwork/oOXrKJ)\\n\\n\\n## Day 5 - Drawing from imagination\\n\\nThere were a lot of tree styles I liked so I attempted to do a variety of them from memory. The vector type, the take it slow type, and a block-y painting type.\\n\\n![](/img/wap/wap-9.5.jpg)\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nI don\u2019t feel like I have strong takeaways from this week except for the new found curiosity to keep exploring other styles. I wasn\u2019t expecting trees to have so much variety but I guess since they are one of the most common elements to a nature scene they are re-produced constantly. So I can see re-visiting trees in the future as there are more on my Pinterest board I\u2019d like to experiment with.\\n\\nWith NaNoRenO starting today I\u2019m thinking of putting my Weekly Art Practice work on pause while I focus on all the art pieces needed for the VN. Got a few scene sketches started today, a meer fraction of the work ahead for the planned project. But I\u2019ll probably keep to weekly blogging just with sharing game progress instead of practice progress.\\n\\n[Tree Pinterest board.](https://www.pinterest.ca/maeanu3639/wap-tree/)"},{"id":"wap-8","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/wap-8","source":"@site/blog/2024-02-24-week8-wap.md","title":"Weekly Art Practice - Week 8","description":"Week 8 - Lighthouses and landscapes","date":"2024-02-24T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"art","permalink":"/blog/tags/art"},{"inline":true,"label":"wap","permalink":"/blog/tags/wap"}],"readingTime":4.215,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Kylie","title":"Admin","url":"https://github.com/kylies","imageURL":"https://github.com/kylies.png","key":"kylie","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Weekly Art Practice - Week 8","description":"Week 8 - Lighthouses and landscapes","slug":"wap-8","enableComments":true,"authors":["kylie"],"tags":["art","wap"],"Image":"/img/wap/wap-8.3.jpg"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Weekly Art Practice - Week 9","permalink":"/blog/wap-9"},"nextItem":{"title":"Weekly Art Practice - Week 7","permalink":"/blog/wap-7"}},"content":"This week is another alternate take on the format. With the plan to do NaNoRenO in March, I know I\u2019ll need to draw a look of backgrounds in a short amount of time. The game I\u2019ve been ruminating on is set around a lighthouse which would mean a lot of outdoor shots and probably some establishing landscape shots. These have never been a strength of mine so I wanted to spend a week trying to figure out a style that would work for both:\\n\\n1. The vibe of the game\\n2. Could be executed quickly\\n\\nThis leads to trying to find the right balance of detailing. I attempted to try out a few different approaches to this, taking lots of inspiration from [Jacob Drawfee\'s \u201cI made myself draw backgrounds every day for a week\u201d](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dkX9Ul6kywM). While also trying to remember the main take aways from the [landscape course](https://www.kymira.ca/blog/landscapes/) I did last year.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## Day 1 - Drawing from imagination\\n\\nDay 1 was the usual attempt to draw from imagination. I did some quick sketches to try to just think about composition and maybe about the kind of view I wanted to have for the game.\\n\\n![Sketchbook sketches of coastlines](/img/wap/wap-8.1.jpg)\\n\\nI also did some digital attempts on day 1 because I had the time. I tried to limit each one to an hour, focusing on laying down blocks and colours.\\n\\n![Steven Universe inspired style of coastlines](/img/wap/wap-8.1.2.jpg)\\n\\nKeep these first attempts in mind as we move through the next ones.\\n\\n\\n## Day 2 - Testing styles\\n\\nI had gathered up a lot of different stylized landscapes for the week, a lot of them ended up being this kind of vector style which I do find rather quick to execute. For the first piece I just tried to copy the vibe without vectors to see if I could keep it so clean.\\n\\n![Vector landscape studies](/img/wap/wap-8.2.1.jpg)\\n\\nVector pieces from [Creative Market](https://creativemarket.com/Lembergvector/4445148-Foggy-morning-mountains-countryside?epik=dj0yJnU9bG1DWWZlTy14QjBmSVQ1M0MyeHhtQ2lEWk45ajh5VXgmcD0wJm49SUxSb09rWm9NOUVSb1ZZNnlsNmtydyZ0PUFBQUFBR1hhTWEw).\\n\\nThen I chose a reference image and tried out a few more painterly + cartoon style. I didn\u2019t love this and it felt like it sucked up a lot of time with little reward.\\n\\n![Painting studies.](/img/wap/wap-8.2.2.jpg)\\n\\nPhoto by [James Wheeler](https://www.flickr.com/photos/james_wheeler/7909499810/).\\n\\n\\n## Day 3 - Reference studies\\n\\nNow we\u2019re into style practices. This first one is an image I really loved when I saw it. I have a high suspicion that it\u2019s AI created and now I\u2019m wondering if I should just spend my live re-drawing AI art. In this instance I changed it up by replacing the cabin with a lighthouse.\\n\\n![](/img/wap/wap-8.3.jpg)\\n\\nThis piece took somewhere from 3-4 hours. Not ideal but I am pretty pleased with it. I found ways to speed it up and also found some brushes for texture I really liked as well.\\n\\nTwist, turns out it\'s not AI! Cabin art by [Christopher Oliver](https://www.artstation.com/artwork/NGZdbD)\\n\\n\\n## Day 4 & 5 - Style studies\\n\\nI gave myself an extra practice day this week since there was so much I wanted to cover. This time I was working from a photograph again.\\n\\nFor the first I wanted to try to be slightly more detailed but still kind of simple blocks for the buildings. The field is a bit of a trap in that you can spend so much time trying to detail grass and flowers. I could see myself enjoying this but it wasn\u2019t the focus of the piece and I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be drawing many grass fields next month.\\n\\n![](/img/wap/wap-8.4.1.jpg)\\n\\nReference: [Photo by Doug Kerr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/dougtone/7458218088/)\\n\\nFor the extra day I wanted to try another simple looking style. A little bit like a comic or graphic novel. Flat colours and maybe more detailed line work. I also like this as a style but we\u2019ll see in my final test how I\u2019m going to struggle to really adapt it to my west coast inspired scenery.\\n\\n![](/img/wap/wap-8.4.2.jpg)\\n\\nReference: [Art by Cosimo Galluzzi](https://poolsofchrome.tumblr.com/), photo by [Elenore Bridge](https://www.leblogdelamechante.fr/blog-mode/cavendish/)\\n\\n## Day 6 - Drawing from imagination\\n\\nFor this last challenge I time boxed myself to 1 hour to see how far I could get in that amount of time. I wanted to prioritise the kind of flat colours style from the previous challenge while using some of the vector tricks to add depth or texture in the distance.\\n\\n![](/img/wap/wap-8.5.jpg)\\n\\nIt does feel like with another hour I could get to something I like. Though I\u2019m not sure if this style is really what I want for the project. I just feel like I\u2019d like a little more texture. Working in some watercolour techniques might be my next exercises.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nThis was a fun week but it was also very time consuming. For most of the piece I put in 2-3 hours every day into working on something. Which is more time than I had planned to devote to art practice every week. But it also felt good to work on things outside my comfort zone again.\\n\\nNext week is going to be a slightly complimentary exercise, but on a much smaller scope. I want to try to just draw a bunch of trees.\\n\\n[Lighthouses & landscapes Pinterest board.](https://www.pinterest.ca/maeanu3639/wap-lighthouse/)"},{"id":"wap-7","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/wap-7","source":"@site/blog/2024-02-17-week7-wap.md","title":"Weekly Art Practice - Week 7","description":"Week 7 - Rabbits","date":"2024-02-17T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"art","permalink":"/blog/tags/art"},{"inline":true,"label":"wap","permalink":"/blog/tags/wap"}],"readingTime":3.575,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Kylie","title":"Admin","url":"https://github.com/kylies","imageURL":"https://github.com/kylies.png","key":"kylie","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Weekly Art Practice - Week 7","description":"Week 7 - Rabbits","slug":"wap-7","enableComments":true,"authors":["kylie"],"tags":["art","wap"],"Image":"/img/wap/wap-7.2.jpg"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Weekly Art Practice - Week 8","permalink":"/blog/wap-8"},"nextItem":{"title":"Weekly Art Practice - Week 6","permalink":"/blog/wap-6"}},"content":"This week we\u2019re back in my comfort zone; drawing creatures.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## Day 1 - Drawing from imagination\\n\\nDay 1 felt decently smooth. Rabbit\u2019s aren\u2019t the most complicated creatures and I feel like I see them in images on a regular basis (unlike pangolins).\\n\\n![](/img/wap/wap-7.1.jpg)\\n\\n\\n## Day 2 - Figure sketching\\n\\nI feel like I keep giving myself more and more time for the day 2 practice but I really need to start forcing myself to limit how much time I spend on each sketch. It\u2019s just nice to stare at cute bunnies.\\n\\n![Rabbit sketches using references in a sketchbook.](/img/wap/wap-7.2.jpg)\\n\\n\\n## Day 3 - Reference studies\\n\\nDay 3 spent analysing the inner bean shape of rabbits, smaller chest area, larger hide quarters and face slightly similar to a squirrel but like a soft sided triangle. A decent amount of squirrel similarities really. But rounder.\\n\\n![](/img/wap/wap-7.3.1.jpg)\\n\\n![](/img/wap/wap-7.3.2.jpg)\\n\\n![](/img/wap/wap-7.3.3.jpg)\\n\\n\\n## Day 4 - Style studies\\n\\nMy favourite day! There is so much rabbit art out there. And so much from Japan and Korean with such cute simple styles. Overall I worry that the styles I chose were a little too simple as Pinterest was pretty full of this kind of thing.\\n\\n![](/img/wap/wap-7.4.2.jpg)\\n\\nI found one batch that has a more Disney-type look to it. More details, more kind of human expressions on them. But with some really fun proportion play with feet and ears.\\n\\nReference: [By Andrew Wamboldt](http://heffysdoodles.tumblr.com/post/81610281883/some-warmup-buns-with-a-special-guest-some-may)\\n\\n![](/img/wap/wap-7.4.1.jpg)\\n\\nThese little guys are very good and I was intrigued by the broken line art style. Where you leave gaps in the lineart to convey the fuzzy or fluffiness. I never try this myself as I worry I don\u2019t have the knowledge to know when to break it up and when not too but after staring at these I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a solid rule to it. So maybe something I can incorporate into other creature drawings.\\n\\nReference: [@yura_inaho on Twitter](https://twitter.com/yura_inaho)\\n\\n![](/img/wap/wap-7.4.4.jpg)\\n\\nThese guys were probably my favourites for their mix of simplicity and identifying characteristics. 12 different types of buns, most of them being visually unique. A big thing for rabbits seems to be mixing up the line work to show different fur types, from the very shaggy to the shorter haired guys.\\n\\nRefernce: [@taiga15 on Twitter](https://twitter.com/taiga15/status/1254577826574987271)\\n\\n![](/img/wap/wap-7.4.3.jpg)\\n\\nThe simplest style of all.

I\u2019m still not sure if this is better for absorbing lessons or not. I did feel a little creatively stuck when I started, thinking directly of the images I had sketched just days before. While rabbits are nice to look at and all, I felt like I had limited pose material to choose from. I think what I really need to start pushing myself to do is to change my perspective on creatures, move the camera up and down, and have more angles. Just to keep things interesting and see if I understand the shapes from all sides.\\n\\n![](/img/wap/wap-7.5.jpg)\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nWhile I appreciated returning to a nice easy creature week, I don\u2019t feel as confident about my takeaways due to rabbits being mostly fur. They are another creature that I feel like I should take some time looking at skeletal references to understand what\u2019s going on under all the fluff. Instead of just drawing shapes that imply a rabbit underneath.\\n\\nI\u2019m making some edits to my subjects for the next few weeks as I\u2019m considering participating in [NaNoRenO](https://itch.io/jam/nanoreno-2024). A yearly game jam where you try to make a visual novel in the software Ren\u2019py within the month of March. I had already started brainstorming a text based game a few weeks before a friend mentioned the game jam to me. And now it feels like kind of perfect timing. Creatively if not great life timing.\\n\\nYou are allowed to create any art assets before March 1st but I know my landscape skills are rusty from last year\'s lesson on them, so next week I\u2019ll try to do a week of landscape / coastal vistas while trying to figure out an art style that will work for very quick asset creation in March.\\n\\n[Pinterest board of rabbits.](https://www.pinterest.ca/maeanu3639/wap-rabbit/)"},{"id":"wap-6","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/wap-6","source":"@site/blog/2024-02-09-week6-wap.md","title":"Weekly Art Practice - Week 6","description":"Week 6 - Goblins","date":"2024-02-09T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"art","permalink":"/blog/tags/art"},{"inline":true,"label":"wap","permalink":"/blog/tags/wap"}],"readingTime":4.885,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Kylie","title":"Admin","url":"https://github.com/kylies","imageURL":"https://github.com/kylies.png","key":"kylie","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Weekly Art Practice - Week 6","description":"Week 6 - Goblins","slug":"wap-6","enableComments":true,"authors":["kylie"],"tags":["art","wap"],"Image":"/img/wap/wap-6.5.jpg"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Weekly Art Practice - Week 7","permalink":"/blog/wap-7"},"nextItem":{"title":"Weekly Art Practice - Week 5","permalink":"/blog/wap-5"}},"content":"This week we\u2019re breaking from the format. Kind of in a small way, kind of in a big way. For this week I chose goblins.\\n\\nNow it\u2019s kind of just like doing another creature, except it has humanoid anatomy and it\u2019s well, not real. There are no real life photographs to learn from for fictional creatures. I wasn\u2019t sure exactly how I was going to deal with this lack when I started the week but I feel like I found a decent formula.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## Day 1 - Drawing from imagination\\n\\nDay 1 was just like other day ones. I had just recently put together my Pinterest board of goblins so they were decently fresh in my head when I sat down to do this.\\n\\n![](/img/wap/wap-6.1.jpg)\\n\\nStill have that usual day 1 messiness but there was one standout face for me.\\n\\n![](/img/wap/wap-6.1.2.jpg)\\n\\nThis guy surprises me, one of those \u201cdid I draw that??\u201d moments. It\u2019s not like it\u2019s overly complicated but I would usually need to be looking at a reference to get down that face shape!\\n\\n## Day 2 - Figure sketching\\n\\nFor this day 2 I didn\u2019t use photographs but instead tried to pull from my whole Pinterest board. I jumped around from image to image, whichever caught my attention. With a goal of trying out very different goblin styles.\\n\\n![Goblin sketches using references.](/img/wap/wap-6.2.jpg)\\n\\nI had hoped to be able to put together a bit of a visual history of goblins and identify current goblin media designs, but Pinterest wasn\u2019t super great at providing that selection. The big ones that came to mind were Magic the Gathering goblins and D&D goblins. Then throw in some cartoon goblins like the ones from Adventure Time. This is probably a do-able project but it would have taken many more days than the hour or so I gave myself to collect references and read the Wikipedia page on goblin origins.\\n\\n## Day 3 - Reference studies\\n\\nFor day 3 I took my favourite little guys from day 2 and spent more time on them. Tried to look critically at face shape, general body proportions, and ears. These are the standout goblin qualities to me.\\n\\n![](/img/wap/wap-6.3.jpg)\\n\\nThese three felt like they covered different vibes well. I flubbed the very cartoon guys as I tried to push myself on that one instead of re-creating since they had such simple shapes. Maybe not so simple after all\u2026\\n\\nThe ones in red are what I did after the main three. Trying to merge things together and try to identify what kind of vibe I wanted to bring to my own goblin style.\\n\\n## Day 4 - Style studies\\n\\nNow day 4 is usually style study, but I had basically done that on day 3. I didn\u2019t want to come out of this week having just ripped off someone else\u2019s goblin design so for day 4 I wanted to try out creature design.\\n\\nI chose my main contenters from day 3 (leaving out simple blob goblin as the first 2 felt like they would make more fitting D&D art). I then found some reference poses, sketched out that wireframe, tripled the frame and drew the same pose 3 times. Times 2 as I did the exercise twice.\\n\\nThe first one was my fave little grumpy guy. I\u2019m very in love with his huge lower jaw. The second guy has great years and a very simple face that looked good on everything. The 3rd one is me taking my favourite parts of the first two and trying to create something new.\\n\\n![](/img/wap/wap-6.4.jpg)\\n\\nFound a middle ground for the ears, mouth from one, nose from the other. Clothing ended up being a bit of a combo and I still don\u2019t love it but this wasn\u2019t a clothing challenge so I let it slide for the exercise.\\n\\nOverall I\u2019m happy with my 3rd form guy. While it doesn\u2019t feel like the most unique thing in the world, I knew that once I took this design into day 5 I would likely start to deviate even further from my references.\\n\\nReference: Grumpy goblin: This one was impossible to find due to the internet being flooded with Baby Yoda art.

Poses wasn\u2019t my area of study for the week and I didn\u2019t want to waste too much time troubleshooting poses when what I was really focused on was character design.\\n\\n![](/img/wap/wap-6.5.jpg)\\n\\nI\u2019m pretty happy with how the goblin guys turned out! The central design didn\u2019t changes too much but I have started to second guess the big ears. I\u2019m also struggling with how to handle the large mouth from multiple angles so that might be a long term project. Playing around with expression would also be fun.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nWith our iPad being on life support I returned to my Huion and I think I\u2019m really coming around to sketching with it. I\u2019ve warmed up to the default CSP pencils and now really like how they make sketches look.\\n\\nWhile there was the extra struggle this week of having to alter the daily programming, I feel like I landed somewhere near typical character design. I could have played with shape language more, and pushed things harder on clothing and expressions but still trying to keep these daily practices fairly focused to avoid feeling overwhelmed.\\n\\nThis week I even spent time inking and colouring one of my practice guys from day 4 instead of day 5 because I was already pretty happy which what I was producing.\\n\\n![](/img/wap/wap-6.4.2.jpg)\\n\\nNext week I\u2019ll return to a more traditional subject: rabbits.\\n\\n[Pinterest board of goblins.](https://www.pinterest.ca/maeanu3639/wap-goblin/)"},{"id":"wap-5","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/wap-5","source":"@site/blog/2024-02-04-week5-wap.md","title":"Weekly Art Practice - Week 5","description":"Week 5 - Hair styles","date":"2024-02-04T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"art","permalink":"/blog/tags/art"},{"inline":true,"label":"wap","permalink":"/blog/tags/wap"}],"readingTime":4.455,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Kylie","title":"Admin","url":"https://github.com/kylies","imageURL":"https://github.com/kylies.png","key":"kylie","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Weekly Art Practice - Week 5","description":"Week 5 - Hair styles","slug":"wap-5","enableComments":true,"authors":["kylie"],"tags":["art","wap"],"Image":"/img/wap/wap-5.3.2.jpg"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Weekly Art Practice - Week 6","permalink":"/blog/wap-6"},"nextItem":{"title":"January extras","permalink":"/blog/january-extras"}},"content":"This is another week where I wanted to push the boundaries of the format. A large part of drawing practice is to get more ideas into your head, basically to build a shape library. So my goal with this week\u2019s focus was twofold: broaden my mental library of hair styles and also find ways to convey hairstyles as minimally as possible.\\n\\nAfter 5 days of it, I\u2019m not sure how I feel.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## Day 1 - Drawing from imagination\\n\\nDay 1 as usual was pretty messy. Put down some vague head shapes and attempted to think of hair styles I know. This day is always a little difficult because you come up against the blank page of your mind. The classic moment of \u201chave I even seen hair before?\u201d when you try to mentally form an image in your head.\\n\\n![](/img/wap/wap-5.1.jpg)\\n\\n## Day 2 - Figure sketching\\n\\nDay 2 went a little better, the gift of being able to look at references. But this leads to falling into the hair trap: Drawing too many lines.\\n\\nI\u2019ve done hair tutorials before, I know that for drawing detailed hair you want to break it down into sections and try to just draw those sections, add minimal individual strands at the end to add a few fly aways or play with the shape. I find this very hard to do when working from a photo reference as hair is so messy. And the more time I spend on them the more lines I keep adding.\\n\\n![Quick hand sketches using references](/img/wap/wap-5.2.jpg)\\n\\n## Day 3 - Reference studies\\n\\nThis day is supposed to be spending more time with the photo references but that just means adding more strands and making more of a mess :\u2019) I\u2019m not sure why this week feels like it\u2019s going so bad but I\u2019m starting to feel like hair styles may have been too big of a topic. I possibly could have tried a sub theme, like up-dos or long or lose hair. By just trying to do a large variety of hair styles I didn\u2019t feel like I could focus on learning a few tricks to pull off something specific.\\n\\n![](/img/wap/wap-5.3.1.jpg)\\n\\n![](/img/wap/wap-5.3.2.jpg)\\n\\n![](/img/wap/wap-5.3.3.jpg)\\n\\n![](/img/wap/wap-5.3.4.jpg)\\n\\n\\n## Day 4 - Style studies\\n\\nWhen choosing styles to study I very much focused on simplified cartoon styles. Stayed away from over the top anime styles and didn\u2019t want anything super realistic. But I worry this has led to almost too much simplification and I\u2019d like to find a style somewhere in the middle.\\n\\nI tried using only forward facing faces for this day to make myself think of the hair style from a slightly different but consistent angle.\\n\\n![](/img/wap/wap-5.4.1.jpg)\\n\\nReference: The original link to this one on Instagram seems to be dead [but found a reference to it here.](https://beautifuldawndesigns.net/how-to-draw-hair-step-by-step-tutorials/)\\n\\n![](/img/wap/wap-5.4.2.jpg)\\n\\nReference: [ABD Illustrates](https://abd-illustrates.tumblr.com/)\\n\\n![](/img/wap/wap-5.4.3.jpg)\\n\\nI think this is the middle ground cartoon style I like most. But when looking at these a lot of the bangs and overall styles were a little too un-realistic to me. The artist does say they were exploring futuristic hairstyles so I don\'t think they are supposed to be the most realistic styles out there.\\n\\nReference: []@Cheriiart on Twitter](https://twitter.com/cheriiart/status/1187823921938092032)\\n\\n![](/img/wap/wap-5.4.4.jpg)\\n\\nThis is probably the most simplified style out of all of them. Mostly just the exterior lines to show the shape of the hair.\\n\\nReference: This is my first full failure to find a reference source. This image has been pinned on Pinterest so many times I can\'t find a non-Pinterest source. One source was a video so it might be from a TikTok????\\n\\n\\n## Day 5 - Drawing from imagination\\n\\nWhile I often feel a little bit of fear on day 5, this is the time I probably feared it the most. Partially because I didn\u2019t feel like I had any big insightful moments during my reference or style study days. And additionally because I didn\u2019t come up with a way to make the \u201cfinal project\u201d more engaging than drawing shapes on mannequin heads. So I did a few sheets.\\n\\n![](/img/wap/wap-5.5.1.jpg)\\n\\nThese left me feeling rather underwhelmed so I stopped for the day and let myself ruminate on it for a little longer. The next day I sat down and tried to do something a little more directed, which led to you getting to play a Guess That Hair game.\\n\\n![](/img/wap/tng_hair.jpg)\\n\\nI did look at references for this as the challenge wasn\u2019t just to draw hair but to get it close enough to be able to guess the character just by the hair style. While I don\u2019t feel like this is an overly impressive piece by any means, I am happy that they are all clear to me at a glance. So while I don\u2019t feel confident in my mental library of hair styles I do feel like I\u2019ve found some confidence in translating hair styles into a simplified art style.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nI think my lesson for this week is that not all subjects can be covered in a week. While I kind of came to the same conclusion with hands I at least felt like I made progress there while with hair I feel like I just scratched the surface. My biggest takeaway is that I really enjoyed drawing coily hair, it has such a great shape and variety to it.\\n\\n[Pinterest board of hair.](https://www.pinterest.ca/maeanu3639/wap-hair-refs/)"},{"id":"january-extras","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/january-extras","source":"@site/blog/2024-02-01-january-extras.md","title":"January extras","description":"A few pieces completed in January","date":"2024-02-01T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"art","permalink":"/blog/tags/art"}],"readingTime":3.815,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Kylie","title":"Admin","url":"https://github.com/kylies","imageURL":"https://github.com/kylies.png","key":"kylie","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"January extras","description":"A few pieces completed in January","slug":"january-extras","enableComments":true,"authors":["kylie"],"tags":["art"],"Image":"/img/artwork/esior.jpg"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Weekly Art Practice - Week 5","permalink":"/blog/wap-5"},"nextItem":{"title":"Weekly Art Practice - Week 4","permalink":"/blog/wap-4"}},"content":"The weekly art practice posts are taking up a large portion of my creative time but I\u2019m still working on other pieces alongside them. A classic instance of the more time you spend doing a hobby the more you want to do it. The near daily art practice is helping me feel \u201cwarmed up\u201d most days, I don\u2019t feel like I need to ease into art every time I want to start something new now. Still rather shocked at how much I\u2019m making.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## Courses\\n\\nCourses aren\u2019t my big focus for this year but I\u2019ve done 2 small little focused things so far.\\n\\n### Domestika course: Illustrating Fantastical Animals with Procreate\\n\\n[Julia K\xf6rner](https://www.domestika.org/en/courses/3163-illustrating-fantastical-animals-with-procreate) is an artist I found on Instagram and saw she had a Domestika course. This was one of the main things that tempted me into a Domestika subscription. I was curious to see what went into her pieces that made them so soft and light.\\n\\nThe course ended up being a pretty typical \u201cfollow-along\u201d of the kinds I had done a bunch of on 21Draw. The key takeaways being what kind of brushes an artist uses to get their effects and how do they texture or use light. I attempted to follow her flow when working on this piece of a kobold submarine captain from my current D&D campaign.\\n\\n![An orange kobold holding a large wrench](/img/artwork/esior.jpg)\\n\\nI\u2019m decently happy with how this one came together, used a few shading techniques that I don\u2019t often do and I like how soft everything looks in the end. Though I can\u2019t say I feel like I have any confidence in being able to draw any more like K\xf6rner does by the end of the course. Her unique approach to animals is still very goals.\\n\\n### Live Drawclass\\n\\nI\u2019ve shared a link to a Drawfee Drawclass before, this time I upgraded my Patreon tier and followed one live. The videos are usually posted a month or so after they happen so this one on Character Design should be on YouTube soon.\\n\\nI was a little disappointed that there wasn\u2019t a clear process or steps explained as I\u2019m a very steps oriented person. Just throwing stuff down or working through multiple ideas isn\u2019t something that helps me focus. But it was still helpful to listen for the two hours and try to apply what was being talked about to my own sketches during the class time.\\n\\nI tried out Jacob\u2019s first character in a different pose and then simply copied the face he drew. He started with the idea of \u201ctired eyes\u201d which is something I hadn\u2019t tried before so I just wanted to see if I could pull off the same look.\\n\\n![](/img/artwork/drawclass1.jpg)\\n\\nIn the second part I tried to approach the prompt on my own. A plucky sidekick for the first character.\\n\\n![](/img/artwork/drawclass2.jpg)\\n\\n\\n## More D&D art\\n\\nThis is a digital re-draw of a piece I did probably 3-4 years ago now. I decided to use them as a character in my current underwater D&D campaign. I had them planned for a year before even starting the campaign, and I knew I wanted a new version of the piece to show the players for when the reveal would happen. It took almost a year of running the campaign before I even got to that reveal and I still didn\u2019t finish this piece 2 months before I shared it in game.\\n\\n![A drider hiding behind a large colourful crystal.](/img/artwork/yirrekeb.jpg)\\n\\n## Website icons\\n\\nThese were a headache. I had tried learning vector art many months ago now and failed to produce anything I was happy with. In my first attempt I was trying to re-create icons I had drawn in a regular art program. These ended up being too detailed and had too many colours to keep the svg format happy. I got frustrated and gave up on them.\\n\\nThis time around I was going to go in fresh. Which meant finding/learning a new program that would do svgs and choosing new ideas. I ended up using Linearity Curve for the iPad and it wasn\u2019t terrible. It even had a \u201ccovert to vector\u201d-like feature that you could do to any image. I did this for one royalty free squirrel photo I found, which became icon number one. Then I traced over messy sketches for squirrel 2 and the crow.\\n\\n![](/img/3icons.jpg)\\n\\nI probably should have done 3 squirrels or something to better convey what each section is but I wasn\u2019t loving the process. Maybe someday I\u2019ll revisit vectors but they just really aren\u2019t my speed."},{"id":"wap-4","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/wap-4","source":"@site/blog/2024-01-26-week4-wap.md","title":"Weekly Art Practice - Week 4","description":"Week 4 - Hands","date":"2024-01-26T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"art","permalink":"/blog/tags/art"},{"inline":true,"label":"wap","permalink":"/blog/tags/wap"}],"readingTime":5.555,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Kylie","title":"Admin","url":"https://github.com/kylies","imageURL":"https://github.com/kylies.png","key":"kylie","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Weekly Art Practice - Week 4","description":"Week 4 - Hands","slug":"wap-4","enableComments":true,"authors":["kylie"],"tags":["art","wap"],"Image":"/img/wap/wap-4.3.3.jpg"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"January extras","permalink":"/blog/january-extras"},"nextItem":{"title":"Weekly Art Practice - Week 3","permalink":"/blog/wap-3"}},"content":"Honestly surprised that this is 4 for 4 this month. Maybe I can do a blog post every week. Though I suspect committing to extremely minimal social time for January and my workplace being a disaster has contributed to having enough time to pull it off.\\n\\nAnyway, I hope you like looking at hands. I don\u2019t find them as exciting as pigeons or squirrels but after a few weeks of easy-ish creatures I wanted to try something that would be a serious push. And which would be applicable to more art pieces. I have an animation I\u2019ve been working on that\u2019s taken twice as long because of how much time I\u2019ve spent fighting with the hands. Ended up going with a very blob like shape in the end just to keep making progress. Time to see if a week of hands can carry me through drawing more hands in the future.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## Day 1 - Drawing from imagination\\n\\nThe first thing I noticed about this week is that it\u2019s difficult to draw hands *without* a reference. They are right there, doing the work, you can\u2019t look away. I tried my best to not do any posing or staring at my hands for too long in hopes of forcing my brain to think of the shapes itself.\\n\\n![Rough hand sketches in a notebook.](/img/wap/wap-4.1.jpg)\\n\\n## Day 2 - Speed sketching\\n\\nDay two I gave myself more freedom to look at local hands while also using some references.\\n\\n![Quick hand sketches using references](/img/wap/wap-4.2.jpg)\\n\\n## Day 3 - Reference Drawing\\n\\nNow with more serious references in play, I\u2019ve come to the conclusion that we shouldn\u2019t render hands too much. When you start looking at the specific details and shapes fingers make in photos, they sometimes translate terribly when putting them to paper. There\u2019s also just so many wrinkles and curves that it\u2019s easy for a hand to become muddy very quickly.\\n\\n![](/img/wap/wap-4.3.1.jpg)\\n\\nThere were 9 hands here but I just went with one or else this could have been the only reference image I needed. Thumb up seemed like a nice starting point. Keep most of the fingers partially hidden.\\n\\n![](/img/wap/wap-4.3.2.jpg)\\n\\nFingers coming towards the camera has always been a weakness of mine. I find it very difficult to convey the depth in a hand so that each finger is still readable.\\n\\n![](/img/wap/wap-4.3.3.jpg)\\n\\nAnother coming towards the camera one, proof I was trying to challenge myself. This hand is one of the ones that helped me see how strangely angular hands can be.\\n\\n![](/img/wap/wap-4.3.4.jpg)\\n\\nAnd then holding a ball. Often if I\u2019m doing a character drawing the character is often holding or touching something so object interaction is a pretty important shape to practise for me.\\n\\n## Day 4 - Style study\\n\\nAfter my conclusion of \u201ctoo much detail = bad\u201d I was excited to get some ideas for simple approaches. I\u2019m often drawing hands on small characters where the hand isn\u2019t the focus but is often trying to communicate something. I just need enough details for it to be clear what kind of action the hand is doing.\\n\\n![](/img/wap/wap-4.4.1.jpg)\\n\\nStarted with fingers. Seems to make sense to start with the small part of a bigger object. I\u2019m pretty familiar with the tube or sausages approach to drawing fingers but this was the first time I saw it done with a variety of perspectives.\\n\\nReference: [Screenshot from a how to draw hands vide](https://www.proko.com/course-lesson/how-to-draw-hands-details-for-realistic-hands/assignments).\\n\\n![](/img/wap/wap-4.4.2.jpg)\\n\\nI enjoy the box breakdown of hands, really helps to keep the 3D shape of the hand. But as I worked on these I did start to feel like they were too realistic to really be a style study.\\n\\nReference: [Tweet](https://twitter.com/GY_ANIFORCE/status/1207239639389466625).\\n\\n![](/img/wap/wap-4.4.3.jpg)\\n\\nNow here are some hands that really embrace the angular-ness of fingers! Each finger looks so strong and expressive. But look at them the wrong way and I get confused at what I\u2019m looking at.\\n\\nReference: [Kiwi Byrd Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/posts/16945474).\\n\\n![](/img/wap/wap-4.4.4.jpg)\\n\\nI fell in love with this style. So sleek and simple but so expressive. The lines are easy to draw after a few tries and it just felt good. I didn\u2019t commit to carrying this style through all my other practices but it\u2019s definitely something filed away in my mind now.\\n\\nReference: [Dom \\"Scruffy\\" Murphy on ArtStation](https://www.artstation.com/artwork/0XmZAe).\\n\\n![](/img/wap/wap-4.4.5.jpg)\\n\\nI caught this one last minute on Pinterest right before I started my drawing session. It was a style different from the other 2 previous ones, more cartoony, which was very much something I wanted to try. Just get even simpler but also rounder and cuter. It makes the hands stand out less but possibly easier to execute.\\n\\nI was enjoying these so I took some photos and tried to adapt those poses with the style.\\n\\nReference: [Freepik](https://www.freepik.com/premium-vector/child-hand-poses-vol-2_3014642.htm).\\n\\n## Day 5 - Drawing from imagination, take 2\\n\\nTest day. After my coloured pigeon piece from last week I decided that I wanted to do something like that as a final project of sorts for each theme. So I started day 5\u2019s drawing time with some sketches, mostly trying to capture the styles that I had practiced the day before.\\n\\n![](/img/wap/wap-4.5.1.jpg)\\n\\nThen I wanted to do something a little more detailed. Something that could be part of a larger piece where maybe the focus of the illustration is on the hands.\\n\\n![](/img/wap/wap-4.5.2.jpg)\\n\\nMy girlfriend says this looks like a tattoo design and after she said it I could see it. Add a bit more ling definition to the flame and it could be a weird clavicle piece.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nIt will get tedious to keep saying \u201cI\u2019m shocked at how much 4 days of practice does!\u201d it does still feel like that every day 5. I honestly enjoy drawing hands but do find it difficult. I think a big part of learning from this week was once again to embrace very simplified styles. And maybe adopt a drawing approach of continuous practice\u2026\\n\\nI\u2019m happy that this week wasn\u2019t as hard as I feared. It didn\u2019t feel overly difficult compared to the creatures from before. And having pages full of floating hands looks pretty cool.\\n\\nLater today I\u2019m attending an online art lesson on the character design process by one of the Drawfee hosts, so I might have a project to blog about from that. I also have a few other fully coloured pieces from the last few months that I haven\u2019t included anywhere. And my attempts at vector art to be the new icons for this site. So I may have multiple posts over the next few weeks. While also trying to prepare and participate in Funguary again.\\n\\nMy hands Pinterest board with all my reference images [can be found here](https://www.pinterest.ca/maeanu3639/wap4-handrefs/)."},{"id":"wap-3","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/wap-3","source":"@site/blog/2024-01-19-week3-wap.md","title":"Weekly Art Practice - Week 3","description":"Week 3 - Pigeons","date":"2024-01-19T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"art","permalink":"/blog/tags/art"},{"inline":true,"label":"wap","permalink":"/blog/tags/wap"}],"readingTime":3.83,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Kylie","title":"Admin","url":"https://github.com/kylies","imageURL":"https://github.com/kylies.png","key":"kylie","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Weekly Art Practice - Week 3","description":"Week 3 - Pigeons","slug":"wap-3","enableComments":true,"authors":["kylie"],"tags":["art","wap"],"image":"/img/wap/wap-3.3.3.jpg"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Weekly Art Practice - Week 4","permalink":"/blog/wap-4"},"nextItem":{"title":"Weekly Art Practice - Week 2","permalink":"/blog/wap-2"}},"content":"Another week of having a good amount of time to devote to art.

The hardest part is trying to not fall into the habits of drawing other birds. I drew a lot of birds of prey as a kid but pigeons have very little in common with raptors. So I find myself struggling with their longer necks and small beaks.\\n\\nMy pigeons ended up looking more like chickens.\\n\\n![First pigeon sketches.](/img/wap/wap-3.1.jpg)\\n\\n## Day 2 - Figure sketching\\n\\nAs usual I think I\u2019m maybe spending too much time on these.

Love when they bury their head in their big neck and poof up. But I managed to resist and try a few other poses.

I try to choose a variety of them to see some different approaches. Thankfully pigeons aren\u2019t super complicated body-wise, but I feel like it\u2019s still hard to capture their cute-ness.\\n![](/img/wap/wap-3.4.1.jpg)\\n\\nSome nice simple guys here.

This one just felt very expressive with a very simple shape. I made the beak too large on mine but I still find it very cute.

But I felt like this first one was a little too sketch-y to be my final piece for the week.\\n\\n![](/img/wap/wap-3.5.1.jpg)\\n\\nI decided to go for a more stylized one with proper line art and some sort of colour approach.\\n\\n![](/img/wap/wap-3.5.2.jpg)\\n\\nI found it weirdly difficult to make up my mind about soft colours and hard colours here. Ended up with the soft blend on the neck feathers and then the harder greys on the wings. I don\u2019t love the combo but I didn\u2019t like when the neck colours were hard edged.

So here are a bunch of sketches of pangolins.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## Day 1 - Drawing from imagination\\n\\nSince day 1 is drawing from imagination I didn\u2019t want to look at a single reference image before starting. This resulted in a funny mistake.\\n\\n![Messy pangolin sketches.](/img/wap/wap-2.1.jpg)\\n\\nI had a moment early on, of asking myself, do pangolins have ears that poke out? I didn\u2019t want to break the assignment by looking at a reference so I gave them little poky ears\u2026 which was wrong.\\n\\n## Day 2 - Figure sketching\\n\\nI was able to correct my mental image of pangolins on day 2. These quick sketches reinforced my thinking that these guys have a similar build to squirrels in a few ways. They have the same triangle-ish arms, smaller chest zone big butt zone, long tails. But even with those similarities I feel like they give off very different vibes.\\n\\n![Quick pangolin sketches using references](/img/wap/wap-2.2.jpg)\\n\\n## Day 3 - Reference studies\\n\\nI really like day 3. Having an image up and scrutinising it for the mistakes I made in the first 2 days feels like the learning coming together. However this is also when I get torn about being more detail oriented (draw all the armour scales) and skipping over that because it\u2019s not the most educational in these exercises but is fun.\\n\\n![Pangolin walking](/img/wap/wap-2.3.1.jpg)\\n\\n![Pangolin making lovey eyes at the camera.](/img/wap/wap-2.3.2.jpg)\\n\\n![Pangolin trying to be a ball.](/img/wap/wap-2.3.3.jpg)\\n\\n![Close up artsy shot of a pangolin.](/img/wap/wap-2.3.4.jpg)\\n\\n\\n## Day 4 - Style studies\\n\\nHaving seen a few stylizing pangolins in the wild previously I knew I could get some good variety here. I tried to choose some of the more stylized versions to learn from. Especially when it comes to different approaches to doing the scales.\\n\\n![Vector art simplified pangolins.](/img/wap/wap-2.4.1.jpg)\\n\\nThese guys got simplified down to zig zag patterns which is pretty good. Though I don\u2019t love how it makes them look so smooth.\\n\\nReference: [VectorStock](https://www.vectorstock.com/royalty-free-vector/cute-pangolin-animal-in-various-poses-set-rare-vector-25524101)\\n\\n![Pattern based pangolins](/img/wap/wap-2.4.2.jpg)\\n\\nThese guys have just the hint of triangles to convey where the scales would be.

This time the struggle was pangolin poses. While I felt like I had spent the week getting their shape down I didn\u2019t really spend enough time watching them move about. Squirrels I see every day, I get them. Pangolins are pretty mysteries. So I felt a little limited by my ability to imagine them in a variety of poses.\\n\\n![Four digital pangolin sketches.](/img/wap/wap-2.5.jpg)\\n\\nI do at least like them, I think these pieces are still cute and do look like pangolins. But the movement and idea of looking at videos alongside still images is a good takeaway for creatures moving forward.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nWeek 2 felt like it went pretty smoothly. And that\u2019s with the hiccup of sending our iPad in for repairs. So this week\'s digital sketches were done on my Huion tablet that I set up for the first time in 3 years. This meant a little bit of adjustment time and tech troubleshooting before I could get to my daily practice. Slowed me down a bit but should now be prepared to survive without the iPad for a week.\\n\\nNow to prep for week 3: Pigeons\\n\\nMy pangolin Pinterest board with all my reference images [can be found here](https://www.pinterest.ca/maeanu3639/wap-2-pangolin/)."},{"id":"wap-1","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/wap-1","source":"@site/blog/2024-01-04-week1-wap.md","title":"Weekly Art Practice - Week 1","description":"First week of my new art practice schedule","date":"2024-01-04T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"art","permalink":"/blog/tags/art"},{"inline":true,"label":"wap","permalink":"/blog/tags/wap"}],"readingTime":5.48,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Kylie","title":"Admin","url":"https://github.com/kylies","imageURL":"https://github.com/kylies.png","key":"kylie","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Weekly Art Practice - Week 1","description":"First week of my new art practice schedule","slug":"wap-1","enableComments":true,"authors":["kylie"],"tags":["art","wap"],"image":"/img/wap/wap-1.3.1.jpg"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Weekly Art Practice - Week 2","permalink":"/blog/wap-2"},"nextItem":{"title":"Video Games - 2023 review","permalink":"/blog/games-2023"}},"content":"The way I titled this post implies that I\u2019ll post one of these every week\u2026 I don\u2019t think that\u2019s feasible. I have most of the first week of January off so this week is already easier than every week which will follow this year. I think it\u2019s more likely that I\u2019ll try to summarise one or two weeks a month, or I\u2019ll summarise a whole month of practice all at once. It will be difficult to find 15-30 minutes for art every day along with writing and blog management time.\\n\\nBut since I have the time now, I\u2019ll detail how this first week of the Jacob Drawfee Schedule went for me.\\n\\nTheme for week 1: Squirrels.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## Day 1 - Drawing from imagination\\n\\nSquirrels have been one of my obsessions since moving into my most recent apartment. We have a large back patio with an active squirrel highway (telephone line) that provides a lot of entertainment. I have collected a lot of photographs of squirrels hanging out and in the summer we put out water to help them stay hydrated so they come by more often.\\n\\n![Photograph of a squirrel visiting our water dish.](/img/patio-squirrel.jpg)\\n\\nI\u2019ve been trying to draw squirrels for the last year but even with their small form I feel like there is always something lacking from my sketches. They felt like the perfect first theme, giving me a chance to finally troubleshoot what about the squirrel makes them difficult for me to draw. On Sunday I filled a page in my sketchbook with different squirrel attempts while sketching for 15 minutes.\\n\\n![Photo of my sketch book filled with sketchy squirrels.](/img/wap/wap-1.1.jpg)\\n\\n## Day 2 - Speed sketching\\n\\nI prepared for day 2 in advance by preparing a [Pinterest board](https://www.pinterest.ca/maeanu3639/squirrel-refs/) of squirrel photographs as day 2 is basically quick figure drawing. Using references but mostly to grasp shapes and movement of the subject. It did take some time to collect images so I suspect this will be something I\u2019m trying to rush through before every new week starts.\\n\\nI set my timer to 15 minutes again. I probably spent too much time on the first page squirrels, somewhere in the 2-4 minute zone on each. This didn\u2019t feel like enough so I did a 2nd page where I forced myself to move through them a little faster.\\n\\n![Photo of a sketchbook page.](/img/wap/wap-1.2.1.jpg)\\n\\n![Photo of a sketchbook page covered in small squirrels](/img/wap/wap-1.2.2.png)\\n\\nThese felt pretty messy but it was interesting to see these squirrels next to my day 1 non-reference squirrels and see how much of a difference that makes already.\\n\\n## Day 3 - Reference Drawing\\n\\nI switched to the iPad for day 3 because I knew I\u2019d want the ability to draw over reference images. I find this extremely helpful when trying to really get the anatomy and proper shape down from a reference. I chose 4 photos to start with and didn\u2019t give myself a time limit. The goal for the day was 15 minutes but I think I spent closer to 20 minutes on each one.\\n\\n![Squirrel study 1](/img/wap/wap-1.3.1.jpg)\\n\\n![Squirrel study 2](/img/wap/wap-1.3.2.jpg)\\n\\n![Squirrel study 3](/img/wap/wap-1.3.3.jpg)\\n\\n![Squirrel study 4](/img/wap/wap-1.3.4.jpg)\\n\\nI was honestly very happy with the first study. I felt like I got the shapes right and captured a good squirrel face. 3 and 4 were tougher. In 3 I struggled to get the head right and 4 was so different from the other that I could barely get the proportion right. Hence breaking the image into sections and trying to figure it out from there. Overall I think I spent 2 hours from gathering the images to finalising the last one.\\n\\n## Day 4 - Style study\\n\\nI was really excited for day 4 which is for study from other artists. This is to help identify how other artists simplify the harder parts of the subject and which parts they focus on. I know that this is one of my main weaknesses, I often feel trapped between trying to stick to the details of realism or going so simple I love the main features of a creature. Conveniently I already had a [Pinterest board of squirrel art from last year](https://www.pinterest.ca/maeanu3639/squirrel-inspo/). Downside, there isn\u2019t as much cartoon squirrel art as I would like.\\n\\nI chose a few and started to approach them in the same way I did the reference photos. Try to figure out the central shapes, especially the ones that persisted between different artists. The small very simplified squirrels probably ended up being the most helpful as they often came in large groups.\\n\\n![Page one of style practice](/img/wap/wap-1.4.1.jpg)\\n\\n![Page two of style practice](/img/wap/wap-1.4.2.jpg)\\n\\nAfter sketching the reference images, I went and grabbed some more photos and then tried to draw the new photo while using the styles I was copying. This felt like a good stretch to try to apply the style I had been working from to something new instead of just trying to mimic the same image.\\n\\n## Day 5 - Drawing from imagination, take 2\\n\\nDay 5 was scary for me, felt like a test day. This day is meant to be an application of what you\u2019d learned from the past 3 days of drawing from references. I was scared that it would feel like day 1 and that I would be uncomfortable putting pencil to paper without a reference to look at.\\n\\nIn hopes of not getting afraid of the blank page I wrote down a few actions that a squirrel could be doing, jump, sleep, climb, run, sit. I looked back and my past few days of pages and then started drawing.\\n\\n![Day 5 sketches](/img/wap/wap-1.5.jpg)\\n\\nI was honestly rather surprised with the results. I felt like I finally had a good grasp of squirrel faces and proportions, even managed to try out multiple poses without references. Sure none of them were super dynamic but we\u2019re trying one thing pre week. I\u2019m mostly shocked at how much difference 3 days made:\\n\\n![side by side of day 1 and day 5](/img/wap/wap-1-comparison.jpg)\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nI feel like this first week is proof that this is a viable practice approach! I am still afraid of being able to commit to it every week for a year. And lowering how much time I can spend on each day will probably make progress slower (I\u2019m aiming for 15-30 minutes every day instead of the 1-2 hours I did this week). But now that I\u2019m familiar with what\u2019s needed each day I feel like that direction will be enough to carry me through most days.\\n\\nNow to prepare for week 2: Pangolins."},{"id":"games-2023","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/games-2023","source":"@site/blog/2024-01-01-games-2023.md","title":"Video Games - 2023 review","description":"Speed reviews of the games I played in 2023.","date":"2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"games","permalink":"/blog/tags/games"}],"readingTime":9.48,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Kylie","title":"Admin","url":"https://github.com/kylies","imageURL":"https://github.com/kylies.png","key":"kylie","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Video Games - 2023 review","description":"Speed reviews of the games I played in 2023.","slug":"games-2023","enableComments":true,"authors":["kylie"],"tags":["games"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Weekly Art Practice - Week 1","permalink":"/blog/wap-1"},"nextItem":{"title":"Microjournaling aka hobby management","permalink":"/blog/microjournaling"}},"content":"I have re-written this blog post 3 times.\\n\\nI thought it would be easy, thought I could laugh in the face of game journalism. But instead I\u2019ve spent the last 2 weeks being rather critical of game journalism and thinking about how it can even be possible to review games if you don\u2019t finish them or physically have the time to play them to the end.\\n\\nI would be a hypocrite to give a review for games I didn\u2019t finish but also not finishing a game is generally a sign that I wasn\u2019t really feeling it, which is a review in and of itself.\\n\\nSo I think the best way to approach this isn\u2019t to say these are my reviews of games, but these are some games I loved and some I didn\u2019t love so much in 2023 and that\u2019s just one person\'s experience with them.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## The good\\n\\nThis was a banger year for AAA game releases this year. Some long awaited games dropped and they even managed to live up to expectations.\\n\\nThe first AAA game of the year I completed was a hold over. I didn\u2019t get far in **Elden Ring** in 2022 when we bought it, but something in early 2023 brought us back to it and completely hooked us. The early game that didn\u2019t click with me started to make sense, I finally got a grasp on the controls and small bits of the lore felt like the best reward you could find. It also helped that I felt like I started to get really good at it and would spend a lot of my time helping other people kill bosses in their worlds.\\n\\nMy time with **Tears of the Kingdom** was greatly enjoyed, but I still haven\u2019t reached the end. The world is sprawling and there\u2019s a new quest waiting for you under every rock. It was cool to get a voice acted Zelda and the powers you\u2019re gifted at the start of the game were a lot of fun, maybe even revolutionary for games going forward. It genuinely felt like a fresh way to engage with an open world. But I\u2019ll be honest, I didn\u2019t go about the world crafting masterpieces out of tree logs. I\u2019m pretty sure I under-used the crafting feature compared to other people. So while I had many moments of delight and I\u2019m sure what was done here is going to influence game development for the next 5 years, it wasn\u2019t my top game of the year.\\n\\nFire **Emblem Engage** had its moments but it didn\u2019t click for me. I didn\u2019t care for the main characters but I did love some of the side characters and there were some honest moments in the writing that got me to laugh out loud. But it became another game where I didn\u2019t make it to the credits.\\n\\n**Diablo 4** \u2013 I had never played a Diablo game before but my girlfriend has a fondness for them and the promise of couch co-op is all it takes to get me to be excited about a game. This game has some of the goriest cutscenes I\u2019ve ever seen and the story is very dark. But the game play is a nice level of mindless and constant which makes it a great game for melting the hours away while feeling powerful.\\n\\n**Baldur\u2019s Gate 3** was mind blowing for the first 50 hours or so, and then started to close up for me. I loved act 1 and 2 but then act 3 arrived and things began to feel too directed. Which makes sense, the plot lines do need to start wrapping up. But having started 3 new runs of the game in the first few weeks out of excitement, when I did have the credits roll for the first time, I honestly had no feelings of wanting to continue my other playthrough. Everything kind of fell flat.\\n\\nThere is a new epilogue that adds a lot more dialogue between characters at the end which people are hoping improves the ending but I\u2019m not sure when I\u2019ll have time to drop another 70 hours on playing BG3 again just to experience it.\\n\\nThe last AAA game of the year I played was **Mario Wonder**. I\u2019ve loved most Mario platformers and this one has a few new developments which keep things fresh. This is possibly the easiest platformer that\u2019s come out in a while? There are some very difficult levels that are mostly optional and very fun and stressful. But most of the regular levels never took more than one attempt when playing with two people.\\n\\nNow onto some indie darlings.\\n\\nTeenage dinosaurs facing the end of the world. [Goodbye Volcano High](https://goodbyevolcanohigh.com/) is one of the most ambitious musical VNs I\u2019ve ever experienced. ~~I think I have about 1 hour left and I\u2019m dragging my feet on it because I know the end will make me sad.~~ (Finished this hours before midnight on New Years Eve!) It has a lot of interesting stuff going on mechanic wise, small little interactions that keep you physically invested in controlling the character in small ways. The music was the big selling point for me though, I\u2019ve been listening to the [the original sound track](https://dabuaudio.bandcamp.com/album/goodbye-volcano-high-original-game-soundtrack) on repeat for weeks.\\n\\n[NUTS!](https://nuts.game/) I\u2019m not exclaiming this loudly, the title is all in the cap. But the exclamation point was added by me! This game was a gem to find. A natural surveillance game where you set up cameras in a forest to watch squirrels run around in the night. A game targeted specifically at me! I found this game rather scary (you are alone in the woods and this is a big fear of mine in the real world). It\u2019s really not scary but has some minor suspense floating about. This game is available on so many systems now, please play this game so people make more squirrel games.\\n\\nNext up, a game about fate, tarot cards, witches living in space: [The Cosmic Wheel Sisterhood](https://www.cosmicwheelsisterhood.com/). I loved the art for this as soon as I saw it, and the game idea instantly hooked me. I finished this and instantly started playing it again. One of the most unique games I\u2019ve played in a long time.\\n\\nA game I played for the first time this year that\u2019s been on the top of a lot of peoples charts was [Slay the Spire](https://www.gog.com/en/game/slay_the_spire). This was a lot of fun and it\u2019s cool to see the game that likely launched the wave of card based combat that is so prevalent right now. I got through the flow only once and I can see there is much more to the game that I would enjoy but there are too many games to keep playing this one over and over.\\n\\nThe game I had hesitated to play after hearing about it for months was **Vampire Survivors**. And the only reason I gave it a shot was because I had a 3 hour flight to fill and it can be played for free in offline mode on a phone. This game absolutely slaps and is a classic version of \u201cmore than meets the eye\u201d. Just a little weird game that took off overnight, can be bought for 3$ and is super addictive.\\n\\nAnd now for the only AAAA on the list (and likely in existence): **Genshin Impact**. I come and go with Genshin but I\u2019ve played for nearly 3 years straight at this point. While its basic gameplay mechanics aren\u2019t super impressive and I don\u2019t recommend this game to most people due to it being a gatha game, it does keep me coming back. There is something very captivating about watching the evolution of this game, its place in the world, the huge projects Hoyoverse undertakes, and the ridiculous crossovers. I can\u2019t look away from it.\\n\\n## The meh\\n\\n**Dredge** was an early release for the year and one I had on my rader from its demo release in 2022.I was pretty hype for this one, it does a lot of things I love: Weird occult magic in a small isolated town with a bunch of scary underwater creatures. Unfortunately the game fell flat in a lot of areas for me, there were things in the demo I was hoping to see more of but some of those parts of the game didn\u2019t feature as much in the full game (ferrying questionable stuff, struggle to stay alive, development of NPC stories). There have been some expansion since I finished it so I am a little curious to see if the new content would change my opinion but I don\u2019t have the urge to return to it just yet.\\n\\nThe first game I finished for the year was **Spirifarer**, a very beloved indie game that I enjoyed the first 10 hours of but then fell into a repetitive slump. I didn\u2019t love the main story arc and rushed the ending just to get things over with.\\n\\n**Hi-Fi Rush** was a surprise drop. I loved the art style and the fact that it was a rhythm combat game. The story was even decently fun with some good over the top characters. But I fell off of it after about 5-10 hours. There ended up being a bunch of powerup management and that\u2019s something that often turns me off games pretty quickly. Basic concept = lots of fun, developed concept = too much for me.\\n\\n## Analogue Pocket\\n\\nThis post has already gotten too long and I haven\u2019t even managed to mention all the GameBoy games I\u2019ve been playing on our new [Analogue Pocket](https://www.analogue.co/pocket). So I\u2019ll just say GameBoy games are still great, almost shockingly so. My current obsession is playing the French version of Pokemon Fire Red, a game I think I\u2019ve played 3 times in my life already. And I\u2019m now eyeing up games easily over 10 years old for the start of the new year.\\n\\n\\n## Kylie\u2019s State of the Game\\n\\nWhile most games I played ended up in my \u201cgood\u201d category for the year, it\u2019s a little strange to say that there wasn\u2019t a game that surpassed my current top three. (I\u2019m counting Elden Ring as a last year game as that\u2019s when it came out and I finished it before almost all the other games I played this year so it feels like forever ago, I honestly thought it was a year ago).\\n\\nElden Ring \u2013 Hades \u2013 Inscryption\\n\\nEverything I play is compared to those games right now. If I see even just a screencap of those games I want to go and play them again. NUTS came close but it was a pretty small indie project that we won\u2019t see much more of. Baldur\u2019s Gate 3 is technically impressive with it\u2019s huge branching choice system but stumbled at the end and having experienced many bugs in my playthrough (a major one even ruined a dramatic boss fight and story beat) it just can\u2019t stand up to my current top three.\\n\\nWith all these big games dropping this year I\u2019m not sure what to expect for 2024. I\u2019m sure there will be some more stealth drops that will catch the gaming world off guard, but I don\u2019t have anything that I\u2019m waiting for beyond the Elden Ring expansion. So maybe I\u2019ll have time to catch up on some older backlogs for once."},{"id":"microjournaling","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/microjournaling","source":"@site/blog/2023-12-27-microjournaling.md","title":"Microjournaling aka hobby management","description":"How I managed a year of hobbies.","date":"2023-12-27T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[],"readingTime":7.25,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Kylie","title":"Admin","url":"https://github.com/kylies","imageURL":"https://github.com/kylies.png","key":"kylie","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Microjournaling aka hobby management","description":"How I managed a year of hobbies.","slug":"microjournaling","enableComments":true,"authors":["kylie"],"tags":[],"image":"/static/img/micro-journal2.jpg"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Video Games - 2023 review","permalink":"/blog/games-2023"},"nextItem":{"title":"Books - 2023 review","permalink":"/blog/books-2023"}},"content":"This end of year post is rather different from the reviews I\u2019ve been writing. It\u2019s more of a personal review of a journaling method I\u2019ve been using this year to help manage multiple hobbies. If you are extremely minimalist while also loving to plan your life month by month, it could work for you too. But at the moment it\u2019s extremely tailored to me of my kind-of hyper organised lifestyle.\\n\\nThis approach came about after multiple chats with my therapist of me complaining about how I have no time for hobbies and when I commit to one it feels like I lose the ability to stay interested in the rest. I often hyper focus on whatever activity currently has me in its grips. The other focus of this method was to help balance executive dysfunction when it comes to those \u201cI would rather die\u201d tasks. Things like phoning the doctor, filing medical papers, or chores that have been put off for months.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n## Origin\\n\\nEven while being someone who loves to make a to-do list, I haven\u2019t been a journaler since my early teens. Unless we still count LiveJournal, then my early 20s. Once I was done with school the habit died off even more.\\n\\nThe bullet journal fad came and went (still here?) and while I was enamoured with the accessories, washi tape, nice journals, nice pens. It wasn\u2019t enough to get me to commit to keeping a journal.\\n\\nBut then I started therapy and I started to have more things to write down. I loved when my therapist would give me homework or a suggestion on an activity or emotion to chart. I liked being able to look back on progress while reminding myself that therapy was changing aspects of my life.\\n\\nThis never became anything huge but it meant I finally used some pages in my nice notebooks.\\n\\nAnd then there was the pandemic. I was already unemployed when the lockdown part of the pandemic hit Montreal, and like many people I fell into a bit of a malaise. My regular hobbies couldn\u2019t hold my attention, the world was falling apart and I spent hours doom scrolling. This became another thing to come up in therapy and the main suggestion I got was \u201ceven if you don\u2019t feel like doing X will be relaxing, try doing X for 10 minutes\u201d. The idea behind it was to give a hobby an honest try for a very small time commitment. If it wasn\u2019t working I could move on to something else pretty quickly. But if it felt good then I was likely to stick with it for much longer (This is very familiar to how you approach building a regular practice!).\\n\\nWith that advice I made it through the major lockdown and a major life change, touching my hobbies from time to time but mostly letting them fall to the side. At the end of 2022 I felt like things had settled enough that I could give my hobbies another try. But I was ambitious, I didn\u2019t want to get back into one hobby, I wanted to get back to most of them: drawing, reading, website development, and video games.\\n\\n(Video games were the most sturdy hobby, that one never really fell off. The problem with it was that it has the most potential to over take my time and push the other hobbies out.)\\n\\nAnd so with my previous experiences of to-do lists and methods of approaching hobbies, I made myself a single page journal.\\n\\n![Photo of my journaling process. One page is creative goal for the month while the 2nd page is a list of tasks for each month.](/img/micro-journal1.jpg)\\n\\n## The page\\n\\nSingle page maybe isn\u2019t accurate. I used a single page to plan my hobbies over the course of the year, and one more page for dealing with responsibilities.\\n\\nWhen I look at this I feel like I\u2019ve taken bullet journaling to the next level. An approach that was already pretty minimal and now I reduced it even further.\\n\\nFor each month I would prioritise a little bit of each hobby: 1 book, 1 video game, 1 art course, 1 blog post, 1 website project, etc.\\n\\n![Photo of my journaling process. The first page with my hobby goals on it.](/img/micro-journal2.jpg)\\n\\nMy idea behind this was that if I finished my game of the month, I would have to check off the other hobbies before returning to another new video game. This helped me to balance my free time between hobbies instead of just going to the easiest choice with my free time.\\n\\nThe one I do feel like I struggled with was reading. This is a hobby that can suck me in or turn me away. If I read a book I enjoy I\u2019ll start another one quickly and then can often get a streak going. But if I read something less exciting it\u2019s hard to get me to pick up a book for a few months. It was also a challenge because I was trying not to buy every book. I wanted to rely more on the library system. But this made it almost impossible to stick with my pre-planned reading list because most were new releases and the waiting list at the library for those could be months long.\\n\\nNote for myself to take into next year: Just buy a book if I feel like reading it (if I\u2019m still employed anyway). I buy most books digitally these days so it\u2019s not like I need to worry about them taking up space.\\n\\nOverall I loved this page. I loved checking things off, I loved being able to look at it to help me choose what hobby to work on, removing the indecisions of what exactly that hobby would be. If I wanted to read in August I\u2019d check this page and I would prioritise reading what I had chosen way back in January.\\n\\n## Tasks\\n\\nOn the page next to this one I broke it down by months once again. But this time with a to-do list for every month. This one wasn\u2019t filled out at the start of the year like the previous page. It was filled up as responsibilities would arise.\\n\\nThe main goal of this page was to 1 - keep myself focused on the more immediate responsibilities and 2 - stop me from feeling overwhelmed by responsibility.\\n\\nIt\u2019s easy to make a big list for trying to stay on top of everything in life, but that list could potentially be endless. So these lists had to be the things I didn\u2019t want to do but really needed to. Also I tried to limit every month to 5 things. You can do 5 things in a month.\\n\\nSometimes this helped to get those big things done early in the month. A quick checkoff to feel good about myself and then coast on free time for the rest. Some of the items you can see really dragged. Getting carried over to multiple months because I never got around to it (the list isn\u2019t magical, lol).\\n\\nThere is still one major outstanding task I didn\u2019t complete: buying renters insurance. It\u2019s something I really should do but it has multiple steps and involves phoning a company. A herculean task. But I keep copying it over, it keeps being one of my 5 things. Someday it will get done.\\n\\nReally this to-do list approach was about being kind to myself. While it was an act to focus on what I needed to get done, it helped me to know when I could turn off the guilt of not being responsible and just enjoy my time. And by limiting how many goals I would have for a month it rarely meant I had a month that would feel overwhelming.\\n\\n## And that\u2019s microjournaling\\n\\nI\u2019m calling this microjournaling as it\u2019s the smallest form of journaling I\u2019ve tried. Smaller than a bullet?? It takes up one open page of a notebook and nothing else. It takes minimal effort to put together and works more as a reference or guide for making choices. I\u2019m honestly super excited to fill out my page for next year. The only one I can usually fill in at the start is books because I have a huge backlog. For video games I check release dates and plan around those. The rest often get filled in as I find things I want to work on.\\n\\nBut a lot is still up to chance and where my interest takes me.

But I also used to buy many more physical books. These days I\u2019ve prioritised reading on a Kobo due to ease and space. I\u2019ve moved 7 times in the last 12 years, books make up for a lot of weight. I\u2019ve even started to take my books to one of those free micro libraries. Boxes on the side of the street where you can take or leave books. At least the ones I don\u2019t see myself ever re-reading. It\u2019s helped free up space for\u2026 newer books.\\n\\n![Cover images of Iron Widow, Some Desperate Glory, and The Mountain in the Sea](/img/2023-topbooks.jpg)\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## The challenge\\n\\nGoodReads always wants you to give yourself a challenge to read, to state how many books you\u2019ll read in the following year. Knowing my reading habit was on the decline I haven\u2019t been setting this very high. I just had 12 this year (and I\u2019m still one short but suspect I\u2019ll read 1 or 2 over winter break).\\n\\nThis year I really wanted to read the recent faves. Books that were making the lists of most anticipated or best of the year. After years of playing catchup I wanted to see if I could keep up with recent releases.\\n\\nThe answer is no, I couldn\u2019t keep up. But also, since Twitter is dying and that\u2019s where I get a lot of my book news and commentary, reading the hits of 2023 didn\u2019t get me much extra engagement. I would have loved to hear other people\u2019s thoughts on these books as they came out but when you spend less time on social media you end up less social. Go figure.\\n\\nI don\u2019t want to review all the books I read, I put small reviews up on [StoryGraph](https://app.thestorygraph.com/profile/lautir) (the non-Amazon version of GoodRead) and also [GoodReads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2315520-kylie). Here I\u2019m just going to go over my top 3 for the year.\\n\\n## [Some Desperate Glory by Emily Tesh](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/c6402cfc-fff1-4b40-a30b-7ebe32871b68)\\n\\nThis book has been hitting many of the top sci-fi charts for the year. SDG starts out with your pretty typical sci-fi setup. A group of rebel humans fight and prepare for war against an alien race that destroyed their planet. Their sworn revenge keeps them going with small numbers and ageing technology.\\n\\nIt has strong Battlestar Galactica vibes. Military space opera. Not every kid in training gets to join the combat ranks, they are competing for placements. Some are confined to being breeding stock so that the resistance can keep their population alive.\\n\\nThe main character has extremely traditional views (very strong gender rules are enforced, most people on the station are white, and everyone who isn\u2019t human is bad). Her world is turned upside down after an alien is captured and held prisoner, followed by her brother going AWOL. Setting off the chain of events of Kyr (our protagonist) having her eyes opened to the galaxy and what exists beyond her limited space station.\\n\\nAbout a third of the way in, the book does a pretty big twist. So if the opening feels a little too basic (it kind of did for me), hold out till then.\\n\\n## [Iron Widow by Xiran Jay Zhao](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/8f403954-2950-4903-bdc3-cecb460279e2)\\n\\nIt\u2019s hard to beat the opening description line of Iron Widow on StoryGraph.\\n\\n> \u201cPacific Rim meets The Handmaid\u2019s Tale in this blend of Chinese history and mecha science fiction for YA readers.\u201d\\n\\nIron Widow goes hard. A leading character who wants more for herself. A better life, a better system of life. Giant robots powered by sucking the life out of a pair of drivers, tasked with defending civilization from a mysterious powerful threat.\\n\\nWe got death, violence, forced addiction, abuse of all sorts. Quickly followed by a love triangle, political manoeuvring and big plays for power. Everything plays out between gruesome fights and beautiful facades of the lives of pilots. Nowhere feels safe during the story. Even the ending doesn\u2019t let you relax. So it\u2019s a good thing that book 2 is on the way.\\n\\n\\n## [The Mountain in the Sea by Ray Nayler](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/ae637112-1291-493a-bc06-c1d313ae7d83)\\n\\nThis book caught my attention with this blurb before it was released.\\n\\n> \u201cRumors begin to spread of a species of hyperintelligent, dangerous octopus that may have developed its own language and culture. Marine biologist Dr. Ha Nguyen, who has spent her life researching cephalopod intelligence, will do anything for the chance to study them.\u201d\\n\\nIf attending squid classes this year, my underwater themed D&D campaign, and my collection of aquatic art hasn\u2019t given it away, I\u2019m in my cephalopod era. Which is how this and a few other ocean themed books ended up on my reading list. In my initial review I included this list of similar media:\\n\\nYou will like this if you enjoyed things like:\\n- The Arrival\\n- Work by Becky Chambers\\n- The world building of Malka Older\\n\\nThe major themes of Mountain are language (Arrival) and \u2018what is consciousness\u2019 (I feel like Becky Chambers touched on this a bit though there are many others who do as well.). But the reason I included Becky Chambers here is that Ray has a strong human element in their sci-fi like Chambers does. A lot of time is spent thinking about how people exist with new technology and how it shapes life.\\n\\nIn Ray\u2019s story, we are seeing 3 different types of life intersect. The humans, the very first near human passing android, and a group of octopuses. I\u2019ve always had a love for androids living with or as humans in stories, this novel places androids right at the start of that journey. No one else is really writing about the development of octopus societies but that could change in the next few decades as we continue to learn more about them (fingers crossed).\\n\\n## Next year\\n\\nI don\u2019t have a strong focus for what to read next year yet. I have a few things I didn\u2019t get to this year which I definitely want to get to. With my second goal being to read some of the physical books I\u2019ve started to collect. But also maybe revisit some favourite writers from a few years ago who\u2019ve I\u2019ve ignored while trying to branch out and read the new folks rising up.

I had tried a few online learning programs over the years, more so when I was unemployed, but none with a year long commitment. I didn\u2019t have any big plans for the year, I was going in with a kind of consistent job, a life still lived under semi-lockdown, and a longing to return to hobbies I\u2019d struggled to get back into. I wasn\u2019t sure how this was going to go but I had hoped that putting some money down would help motivate me, setting myself a goal of doing 1 course per month.\\n\\nIn the end, I finished 20 of the 24 courses I started.\\n\\nThere\u2019s no way I could review all of them so I\u2019m going to highlight my favourites in case anyone else wants to give 21Draw a chance.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## What makes a good course\\n\\nThere are a few key points that make me view a course positively:\\n- Homework assignments feel worth my time and are present (I\u2019m not building my 10th moodboard)\\n- Lessons are short and have a take away (1 hour of watching someone paint isn\u2019t my jam)\\n- Something new is introduced\\n\\nI was a little surprised at how many of the courses didn\u2019t have any homework and how lots of the illustrations were just watchings someone else work. You can definitely learn a lot from watching someone else work but if they aren\u2019t well set up to show you the settings, brushes and techniques they are using, the take-aways are limited.\\n\\nI also grew tired of how many courses started with the bare minimum of \u201cthis is how you use procreate\u201d. It\u2019s good the first time around, or when an artist explains a more complex or less used feature. But I think 21Draw could benefit from a series of \u201cintro to software\u201d lesson where the basics are covered in a stand alone course and then each artist doesn\u2019t need to repeat the same info in the lessons.\\n\\n## Top 5 courses\\n\\n### [Storytelling with illustration](https://www.kymira.ca/blog/storytelling-illustrations/):\\nGreat at introducing ways to change the feel and story of the scene by using things like perspective, foreground background, and colour.\\n\\n### [How to Stylize Characters](https://www.kymira.ca/blog/stylized-characters/):  \\nI wasn\u2019t familiar with the process of starting from silhouettes before and this has very much changed my way of thinking about character and creature design. And now that I\u2019ve seen it here I\u2019m starting to see it everywhere from professional concept artists I watch. Just some really great, instantly applicable tricks to make your piece more interesting.\\n\\n### [Designing fun animal characters](https://wwww.kymira.ca/blog/bean-approach/):  \\nWhile this introduces a rather simple process for drawing cute characters, the base is really helpful for starting something new. Not only that, its limitations force you to become more creative with it.\\n\\n### [Landscapes](https://www.kymira.ca/blog/landscapes/):\\nI knew nothing about landscapes before this course and now it\u2019s become one of my most common art types of the year. I loved working in greyscale and the slow refinement process that\u2019s introduced really helps make landscapes less intimidating.\\n\\n### [Mastering lighting](https://kymira.ca/blog/learning-light/):  \\nI thought I had a pretty good grasp of light but this course taught me I knew nothing. Covers the terminology for different kinds of light and shadows while showing how to incorporate them into a piece. I had no idea what Mask layers were for before this.\\n\\n### [Intro to animation](https://kymira.ca/blog/2d-animation/):\\nAfter watching multiple intro to animation videos this year I feel like I can confidently say that this one does a good job of covering the main concepts of 2d animation. The assignments were good and I felt like I took away a lot of new knowledge from this one.\\n\\n![The 4 pieces from the light lesson](/img/21-draw-img/Lighting-studies.jpg)\\n\\n## Fav art pieces of the year\\n\\n![Collage of my fave art pieces for the year.](/img/artwork/2023-art-recap.jpg)\\n\\n## Final feelings on 21Draw\\n\\nI\u2019m extremely happy with my 21Draw purchase. There was certainly a variety of quality when it came to the courses. It felt like some had more support than others when being made. And if you take a lot of intro level courses you end up hearing the same intro level content on repeat. It\u2019s a gamble I was willing to take, with the decent sized catalogue of courses there was always something new to try if there was a course that wasn\u2019t working for me.\\n\\nI won\u2019t be renewing my subscription for a 2nd year as I think there\u2019s only 10 courses left that I haven\u2019t checked out. I\u2019m eyeing up the learning platform [Domestika](https://www.domestika.org/en) for my 2024 learning. I do plan to keep an eye on 21Draw releases over the next year, and if they get a few more interesting ones I could see signing up again in the future for the next content.\\n\\nHowever, one major thing has stood out while doing this year in review. I have much fewer completed pieces than I would like.\\n\\nThis is mostly my fault, I didn\u2019t do all the assigned homeworks and baulked at having to do 1 full illustration for a course instead of smaller pieces or homeworks. So while Domestika looks really fun, I\u2019m also considering doing a few months of focused practice instead of focused learning.\\n\\n21Draw was a great way to re-familiarize myself with the basics and also many of the steps of the process I never learned. But when a course is 7 hours long and it\u2019s mostly just watching someone else work, that 7 hours I don\u2019t spend drawing myself.\\n\\nI think for January I\u2019m going to try to follow a practice schedule, specifically the one Jacob Drawfee goes over in this Drawclass: Jacob\'s No Pressure Guide to Learning How to Enjoy Art Practice.\\n\\n<iframe width=\\"560\\" height=\\"315\\" src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/BeP3T511C-w?si=u-RLawqUyXpKyJga\\" title=\\"YouTube video player\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\\n\\nIt boils down to trying to draw 5 days out of the week, with a specific focus for the week and what to do each day. I\u2019d love to say I\u2019ll commit to a year of it but that feels rather intimidating at the moment. Especially with a few projects and volunteer programs in the works for 2024. So we\u2019ll see how far I can get. And if each week might make for a worthy blog post."},{"id":"catch-up","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/catch-up","source":"@site/blog/2023-11-19-catch-up.md","title":"November Wrap Up","description":"October ended up being one of my busiest months of the year, which led to only sporadic 21 Draw lessons between travelling and playing Baldur\u2019s Gate 3.","date":"2023-11-19T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"art","permalink":"/blog/tags/art"},{"inline":true,"label":"21draw","permalink":"/blog/tags/21-draw"},{"inline":true,"label":"altar stone","permalink":"/blog/tags/altar-stone"}],"readingTime":5.67,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Kylie","title":"Admin","url":"https://github.com/kylies","imageURL":"https://github.com/kylies.png","key":"kylie","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"catch-up","enableComments":true,"title":"November Wrap Up","image":"/img/artwork/Fish-sheet.jpg","authors":["kylie"],"tags":["art","21draw","altar stone"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"21 Draw - A year in review","permalink":"/blog/21draw-review"},"nextItem":{"title":"Getting into animation","permalink":"/blog/2d-animation"}},"content":"October ended up being one of my busiest months of the year, which led to only sporadic 21 Draw lessons between travelling and playing Baldur\u2019s Gate 3.\\n\\nIn December I plan to do a few end of year posts which means I want to try to cover the last 2 months of art practice in this post. So buckle in for some random courses and projects from the last 2 months.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## 21 Draw - Pets\\n\\nMultiple new courses have launched on 21 Draw during my year of taking classes which has been very exciting. If a little disruptive to my early plans of having pre-chosen which courses I wanted to focus on. One of these was a course on creating cartoon versions of pets.\\n\\nI don\u2019t have a cat or dog but I have a friend who sends me lots of photos of her cats so I had a lot of material to work with as reference. I didn\u2019t finish this course as I found things start to get pretty repetitive when the artist is covering basic line-art and painting techniques. But the more central part of the program, breaking animals down into basic shapes and ways to portray age and personality with some design choices were helpful.\\n\\nI ended up only working on the sketch phases with the references I had. I do love drawing animals but doing simplifications or cartoonification is definitely a weakness of mine. I struggle to choose what details aren\u2019t important and can be left out. And I struggle to make eyes larger for soften personalities instead of trying to replicate sizes to proper anatomical proportions.\\n\\n![Sketches of Albert and Leon](/img/21-draw-img/Pet-sketches.jpg)\\n\\n## 21 Draw - Colour Theory & Intermediate Procreate\\n\\nI started and nearly finished it (I\u2019ll probably wrap it up next week), a short course of colour theory. A few of the longer digital painting lessons touched on colour theory so a lot of this was repeat information to me but it had a few gems still. Colour theory is something I over think, or that there is some mystical secret behind. But I feel like it really comes down to understanding the colour wheel and having a good eye for colour. I\u2019ve been forcing myself to work with palettes a little more in my last few pieces as well as to use the Procreate colour selector to check complementary and tertiary colours for my main colour themes.\\n\\nThis had a few pieces of homework but none of them interested me so I didn\u2019t do them. I probably should have for the practice but I felt like I had multiple courses on the go at this point and was struggling to focus on putting Apple pencil to tablet.\\n\\nI\u2019m not super confident in my colour selection of pieces, I probably go way too saturated most of the time. And then jump around to whatever colour I like instead of taking the time to see if colours work well together.\\n\\n[Simone Gr\xfcnewald](https://www.instagram.com/schmoedraws/)\u2019s intermediate Procreate lesson has been pretty good but it\u2019s hard to focus on a 5 hour course with no homework assignments. The main thing this course did for me was convince me to buy [Max Ulichney\u2019s Watercolor Brushes for Procreate](https://maxpacks.com/). Simone used these for nearly her whole painting process and I really came around to how they looked and behaved during the main hours I watched her paint.\\n\\n## D&D Maps\\n\\nThese pieces were small projects during the year I didn\u2019t post about as they contain spoilers for the D&D campaign I\u2019m running. They\u2019re maps that are meant to convey locations of places easily to players instead of a battle map. I\u2019ll often find battle maps online for my needs but for more unique locations I want to be able to communicate the area I\u2019ve created and find that this can be more reliably done with images. Hence spending way too much time on these maps that the players may never fully see.\\n\\n![Exploration grid map of a sunken island city](/img/artwork/Ruins-map.jpg)\\n\\n![Layer map of a library carved into an underwater stalagmite.](/img/artwork/Library-outpost-five.jpg)\\n\\n## Altar Stone Projects\\n\\nIt\u2019s been a while since we launched a new song (see October being busy) but I\u2019ve been picking away at putting together scenes for future music.\\n\\nOne project started with a fish sheet.\\n\\n![A sheet of a variety of pink fish.](/img/artwork/Fish-sheet.jpg)\\n\\nI love seeing other artists\' sheets of creatures. There\u2019s often so much variety to each creature and everyone interprets them all a little differently. My fish sheet is all fictional creatures as I wanted to build up a repertoire of basic fish to have around in the D&D campaign. So I spent a lot of time looking at fish and then smashing together my favourite bits of real fish to make up these fake fish.\\n\\nThen I started to animate them.\\n\\nNot all of them, but so far I\u2019ve created simple animation loops for at least 6 of them. Then I made them a place to swim.\\n\\n![An underwater scene of rocks, sea weed, and a dome in the distance.](/img/artwork/Underwater-arch.jpg)\\n\\nI\u2019ve put together this full animated scene already but it\u2019s not online yet, so you\u2019ll have to wait to see the completed piece.\\n\\nNext up was a player request. I introduced a giant awoken octopus as a smith in my underwater city. People thought he was pretty cool and asked if he had a themed song (he did not). But my girlfriend went ahead and tried a few things to put together something that could capture a forge vibe.\\n\\nFor this piece I really wanted to try out the MaxU watercolour brushes I mentioned above. They seem well fitted for background work and I wanted something more gritty and textual than my previous background pieces. This did mean it took much longer as I had both a learning process to get through and many layers to work with to get the right blend of colours and textures from the brushes.\\n\\nI\u2019m not super satisfied with the final product, I know what areas I want to touch up, but I\u2019m leaving them for the animation edits so that I can play with lighting more dynamically instead of having it painted on directly. Hilariously enough, the large octopus going in front of this will cover most of the background anyway.\\n\\n![A scene of a large medieval looking furnace in a forge.](/img/artwork/Forge-bg.jpg)\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nI\'m hoping to squeeze in one more 21 Draw course between November and December. Then my subscription will come to an end. I\'m already making plans for 2024 and what I want to focus on but we\'ll see how well those plans hold up. After a year of trying out a lot of different stuff, I can see myself ending back up at figure drawing lessons once again."},{"id":"2d-animation","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2d-animation","source":"@site/blog/2023-09-24-animation.md","title":"Getting into animation","description":"A few months ago my girlfriend asked if I could draw a piece of art to be the image of a YouTube video for her music.

But this meant having a visual aspect to the music as well.\\n\\nAn idea came to mind pretty quickly for this and I was able to put it almost all tonight in an evening. A large octopus with a sword fight with silhouettes of the characters from the campaign:\\n\\n![A giant pink octopus holding a sword, facing off 5 silhouettes of adventurers.](/img/artwork/octo-fight1.jpg)\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\nBefore we got around to uploading the song, she got the idea to try animating a part of it so it wasn\u2019t just a static image for 1 hour. I cut out the sword as a separate layer, she put both pieces into PowerPoint and ta-da, we got a spinning sword:\\n\\n<iframe width=\\"560\\" height=\\"315\\" src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/mE8iykMUzuk?si=TsYqWsZYlsXYJqLc\\" title=\\"YouTube video player\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\\n\\nWith the publication of this first video, [Project Altar Stone](https://www.youtube.com/@altarstone) was launched, and so began my focus on 2D animation.\\n\\n## From PowerPoint to ToonSquid\\n\\nAs mentioned, my girlfriend animated the first video in PowerPoint and this worked surprisingly well. But PowerPoint has its limitations (you can only animate one thing at a time) and I already had ideas for how the next video could go. I have some video editing experience with a program called Camtasia so this is what I brought the next song project into.\\n\\nUnfortunately, Camtasia was rather limited on the animation front as it\u2019s more designed for traditional video editing (doing green screens, layovers, highlighting mouse movements). I was using it to make tutorial videos at a previous job. But since I had a paid version of this software I was hoping to make it work. After some Googling I learned that my version was a few updates behind and if I wanted to find tutorials or troubleshoot issues I would almost always be finding ones that reference the new version.\\n\\nAnd so the hunt for 2D animation software began.\\n\\nSince I do almost all my digital art on an iPad these days, that\u2019s where the search started. It\u2019s pretty easy to find a top 10 best animation apps list, but still hard to choose one when you don\u2019t really know what features of an app you want are. So I read some guides, watched some videos and eventually settled on a rather recent new program [ToonSquid](https://toonsquid.com/).\\n\\nToonSquid has a few short tutorials on YouTube, keywords I understood (keyframes, onions layers) and a rather impressive intro demo video. And possibly it\u2019s biggest selling point, it was a one time purchase instead of a subscription model! So with that research phase done, it was on to video number 2.\\n\\n\\n## Learning the tools of the trade\\n\\nWith ToonSquid came a lot of learning, watching tutorial videos, experimenting with tools, etc. Our second video came from both of us learning how to use ToonSquid. Definitely had some struggles so this process felt a little messy but resulted in us learning some best practices to take forward into the next one.\\n\\nEven with those learning hiccups, I\u2019m pretty happy with how the video came out with two major objects being animated at once. And it was a good challenge for me to learn to draw and design a fantasy submarine, something I felt pretty scared to do.\\n\\n<iframe width=\\"560\\" height=\\"315\\" src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/OYB_MDRmDq4?si=kDrBCzfaOKHnlj_0\\" title=\\"YouTube video player\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\\n\\nVideo three is rather simple from an animation perspective, but was a big challenge for me as I set myself the goal of drawing an alleyway for a world I didn\u2019t have a great visual grasp of. Did a lot of Pinterest searching for \u2018fantasy market\u2019 and \u2018fantasy alleyway\u2019 to get ideas. Then it was time to get familiar with the perspective tools Procreate has to offer. These ended up great for blocking in the basic shapes and helping to get the lines of the boxes and door at the right angle.\\n\\nOther things I learned in this one was how to make repeating pattern blocks, which is how I made the cobblestone road. This took some precise copy and pasting which I didn\u2019t love as it was easy to mess up the seam lines. But it was cool to learn the basic approach for making repeating patterns.\\n\\n<iframe width=\\"560\\" height=\\"315\\" src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/yRvnEvGGnhs?si=J2zNuo_ocYuT0nrI\\" title=\\"YouTube video player\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\\n\\n(There is a second version of this video with more animations but it\u2019s a secret until a specific D&D session.)\\n\\nVideo three is a return to combat which meant revisiting our very first scene. Coming at this with the knowledge learned from the first three videos made this more complex and also easier. I knew exactly what I needed to be separate layers which would give me lots of options to play with when moving over to ToonSquid. This did result in me hitting the Procreate layer limit for the first time ever, oops. My big mistake in this one is that I did too much shading on the tentacles which completely falls apart once things start moving. Still need to remind myself to not think of these images as static.\\n\\nThanks to all the layers, this is our most active video yet. 8 different tentacles moving at once, the octopus mantle moves a bit, and even got the octopus eyes moving about.\\n\\n<iframe width=\\"560\\" height=\\"315\\" src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/UY0mnrQdfAw?si=0lEylxCRnSRHch1A\\" title=\\"YouTube video player\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\\n\\n## Back to 21 Draw\\n\\nWhen I started going through the 21 Draw course offerings I hadn\u2019t really considered taking the intro to 2D animation one, but once this project started to take off I added it to my queue. It had a lot of the foundational stuff that was covered by the same teacher in his other courses and that I\u2019ve blogged about before. But he spent more time on the 12 Principles of Animation from Disney and ran through what seems like some of the classic beginner animation challenges.\\n\\nI enjoy the practice of starting off learning to animate with a flour sack. For the assignment he gave us making the sack jump:\\n\\n<img src={Sackjump} width=\\"400\\"/>\\n\\nThen we ran through a longer thumbnailing exercise of laying out the key frames of a longer animation. Rabbit character picks up a piece of paper and then ~something happens~ left up for the learner to decide:\\n\\n![rabbit image](/img/21-draw-img/rabbit-animation.jpg)\\n\\n## What\u2019s next\\n\\nWhile the idea of doing a large flip book project is very daunting, it\u2019s something that now feels doable. I was complaining previously about sometimes only having 20 minutes to get some drawing time in and while working on animations 20 minutes felt like a decent amount of time to get a frame or two done. Sure if I think about how little a single frame is seen it can make that kind of work feel less rewarding, but seeing a small animation play out has been a lot of fun.\\n\\nI\u2019m now in the brainstorming phase for future song animations while spending time on YouTube looking for more intro to 2D animation tutorials. Now trying to balance working on animation while still trying to do one or two 21 Draw courses every month."},{"id":"learning-light","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/learning-light","source":"@site/blog/2023-08-29-lighting.md","title":"Learning Light","description":"After getting through a large portion of the beginner level courses on 21 Draw, I finally felt like I could start dipping into the intermediate level courses.

Starting with [Aveline Stokart\u2019s](https://www.avelinestokart.com/) \u2018Mastering Lighting and Shading\u2019.\\n\\nThis is one of 21 Draws top highlighted courses, a large portion of it is even available for [free on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdMxg3lVGGI). Now that I\u2019ve completed the whole thing it definitely deserves the top slot on the website and I would highly recommend it for anyone who wants to get more creative with lighting in their illustrations.\\n\\nIt starts by walking you through the basics of light and shadows on simple shapes. I always forget the specific names for different types of light and shadows so this was good for me, even if I\u2019ve forgotten half of the names already. Then we did some studies of movie scenes to grasp light in action and after that Aveline provides a sketch that you then use to create 4 different lighting scenarios which is where the real takeaways come from.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## Learning to see light\\n\\nOne of the exercises that Aveline gives is to study movie shots. This has come up before in other courses for studying composition and colours, but her approach was all about understanding how light was being used in the scene. Be it to highlight something specific in the scene to draw the eye or set the tone.\\n\\nI chose this Black Swan shot for my study because I wanted something simple to get through the exercises quickly.\\n\\n![A screenshot from the movie Black Swan next to a digital painting copy.](/img/21-draw-img/black-swan-study.jpg)\\n\\nI don\u2019t like it when I look at it in full size as the colours are all off, but every time I see this in thumbnail form on the Procreate project selection screen it looks pretty good!\\n\\n## The base\\n\\nThe base sketch is a girl with a small dragon. We filled in the flats, gave it a simple background and filled in some details like the cookie box and her shirt.\\n\\n![Character in a park on a sunny day.](/img/21-draw-img/base-light-colors.jpg)\\n\\n## Scenario 1: Sunny day\\n\\nThe first lighting scenario was a bright sunny day with the light coming through between the tree branches. It was in this first explainer video that I learned how many layers it takes to do light well. I think Aveline used over 10 different layers to pull off this look. That\u2019s layers for bounce light, ambient light, specular light, general highlights, and on and on.\\n\\nI\u2019d never worked with Mask layers before so this was an interesting one to see right from the start. And makes a lot of sense given a lesson I picked up from a different course: Lighting is more about erasing than painting. You carve out the areas being hit by light. I\u2019ve done that in the past to create minor vignette effects but to see it used to create the main light regions in an illustration was something else!\\n\\n![Character in a park on a sunny day.](/img/21-draw-img/Sunny_Day.jpg)\\n\\n## Scenario 2: Night - Glow\\n\\nIn the second challenge the bright day is completely flipped for a dark night. The lighting layers are all deleted, we keep the base colours around, and start again.\\n\\nI generally find glows really fun to work with in digital art. There are lots of options to play with and room for experimentation. In this scene it\u2019s the little dragon giving off the glow so we have the direction of the light change from the first scene. The light is also more tinted then the light of the sun so the whole scene feels drastically shifted away from the vibrant day.\\n\\n![Character outside in the dark with a glowing dragon.](/img/21-draw-img/Magic_Night.jpg)\\n\\n## Scenario 3: Indoors - Overcast\\n\\nFor scenes 3 and 4 we\u2019ve moved inside. So quickly through a new background together; walls and some hanging art.\\n\\nSame approach, delete all the previous lighting layers, choose a new ambient base colour and start adding layers. I think I went a little too dark on this one, it\u2019s pretty easy to over shoot a colour and a good opacity level.\\n\\n![Character inside on an overcast day.](/img/21-draw-img/Overcast.jpg)\\n\\n## Scenario 4: Indoors - Sunset\\n\\nNow going to warm colours for a sunset vibe that\u2019s much more intense then the overcast day in the previous one. Both of these scenarios moved to a more backlit character and I may have lost details in the girl\'s face. One of the other important tips, which I still struggled to execute, is when it\u2019s okay to cheat.\\n\\nYou can live by the realistic movements of light and shadows but if you want to balance your piece and have the important parts pop, it\u2019s good to \u201ccheat\u201d by adding highlights to locations that need it to stand out. You still follow the rules of the scene, where the lights are coming from, colour, etc. But if it means putting a bit of highlight on a dark face to make a face more visible, it\u2019s usually the right call.\\n\\n![Character inside while the sun sets.](/img/21-draw-img/Sunset.jpg)\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nBefore this course I didn\u2019t think about light too much. I always have a mental map of where light is coming from when shading a character and thought was enough. And sure it was fine for rather flat character work, but going through all the steps to add even baseline lighting to these scenes has reinforced how much heavy lifting lighting does to create a scene and vibe. I feel less afraid to tackle a whole illustration now, and maybe take a few more daring approaches to lighting characters in the future.\\n\\n![All 4 light studies.](/img/21-draw-img/Lighting-studies.jpg)"},{"id":"landscapes","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/landscapes","source":"@site/blog/2023-08-12-landscapes.md","title":"Learning landscapes","description":"While this is one of the most popular courses on 21 Draw I didn\u2019t prioritise it.

My interests had always been more around character design and creatures. But after branching out in a few other courses, I thought it would be time to keep trying to step out of my comfort zone.\\n\\nThis course is taught by [Philip Sue](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCI2LeV6oDbGd8LJ8iUneSZA) and it looks like he has a lot of step by step process videos on his YouTube which likely cover a lot of the things covered in this course.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## Greyscales\\n\\nJust like in a lot of the other courses I\u2019ve taken so far, this one started out with silhouettes. It was a pretty free form first exercise, work with the 5 tones to compose a background, midground, and foreground. The assignment pushed you to make five different pieces which was a good stretch and quickly where I started to diverge a little too much from the guidelines.\\n\\n![Figuring out compositions with greyscale work](/img/21-draw-img/Landscape-thumbnails.jpg)\\n\\nMy first few landscapes felt reasonable, but then I started to get ideas for D&D game locations. These started off problematic as I was too \u201czoomed in\u201d to follow lots of the advice that was being provided for landscapes. They could probably work as general illustrations but there wasn\u2019t enough distance between the features to really follow the next steps. Which is what pushed me to continue with only 2 pieces instead of 3 like the course suggested.\\n\\n## Colours\\n\\nTHe courses provided some palettes to try out but I didn\u2019t want to screenshot the video and then pull the colours into Clip Studio so I looked up some other palettes on Pinterest. These weren\u2019t as curated so it was actually more time confusing and not super rewarding. The orange, desert-y one was from the instructor while my green ring ended up being mostly eye balled. But I was at least happy to have 2 very different colourscapes to work with.\\n\\n![Laying down base colours over the grey thumbnails](/img/21-draw-img/Landscapes-lighting-v1.jpg)\\n\\nThere was a step for experimenting with colours and lighting, and I would have loved to have access to Procreate\'s Gradient Maps for that, but in Clip I played around with colours layers and some manual re-painting. I had always thought I had a pretty good natural grasp of lighting but on trying to get more creative with it in these scenes I started to question that. Good thing there\u2019s a whole class on lighting that I can still take.\\n\\n## Detailing\\n\\nAfter composition and colours comes making the thumbnail huge and getting into the details.\\n\\nThe first one, my desert, thankfully doesn\u2019t have many details going on. Touched up the lighting, added some extra rocks and made a very simple stream. I probably spent just as much time looking for nice cloud brushes. It definitely took a while to get used to the movements of painting and erasing over and over again to try to create the right shapes in the mountains, and I still don\u2019t feel like I nailed that, but I feel like I\u2019m getting closer at least. I re-painted a few of them a few times, trying out different brushes and techniques. Most of them ended up smoothing things out too much and losing the rock-like texture of large sweeping strokes. Which feels like the largest challenge of painting like this, you kind of want to work minimally as more strokes or colours ends up washing out the sharp lines and features.\\n\\n![Final version of my desert](/img/21-draw-img/Desert-landscape.jpg)\\n\\nI\u2019m pretty happy with how this came out in the end. There are definitely areas I can see improvements for already, but it feels \u201cbig\u201d which is what I wanted to learn to do in this course.\\n\\nFor my green pieces I felt like I had fallen into my \u201ctoo zoomed in\u201d habit here a bit too. I ended up spending a lot of time on detailing the big stone ring, and adding plant textures with plant brushes. All the while I should have been working further out to a point of not seeing any of these details.\\n\\n![Final version of my forest ring](/img/21-draw-img/Ring-landscape.jpg)\\n\\nI also struggled with the colour balance a bit more here. I wanted the sun to be rising behind the mountains which made for minimal light hitting the side we could actually see. And some of the mountains felt like they started to disappear, which I guess makes sense if the light is so bright behind them, but I ended up darkening up a lot of features so that the lines between layers of distance still made sense.\\n\\n## Final review\\n\\nOverall I found this course had the perfect balance of lesson + homework. It had some great foundational takeaways and you could instantly apply what was being taught. I struggled a little bit with the program being Photoshop in the course, but nearly all the features also exist in Clip Studio so it was just a matter of figuring out the right tool or button to accomplish the task. The course managed to really break down how to approach landscapes and now I no longer feel intimidated by them. Will definitely draw more in the future."},{"id":"mixed-media-monsters","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/mixed-media-monsters","source":"@site/blog/2023-07-23-mixed-media.md","title":"Mixed Media Monsters","description":"The mixed media course on 21 Draw launched a little over a month ago now.

It\u2019s their first mixed media course which was enough to make me want to give it a try. And it focused on strange creatures so it had a lot going for it in my eyes. It ended up being one of the more detailed courses I\u2019ve taken so far.\\n\\nThe course is hosted by [Eva Toorenent](https://www.evaboneva.com/), an artist with a very unique approach to mixing watercolours with digital colouring. I\u2019ve never done any serious watercolour practice before so I was excited at the possibility of learning a new medium.\\n\\n## Inspiration\\n\\nThe first assignment of the course was 2 questions. I find these things rather cheesy and would usually skip them, but as I said in my previous blog post, doing these courses is my attempt to slow down and do the work.\\n\\n**Question 1: What gets you excited/happy? What can you talk about for hours? (5 sentences)**\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\nThis is a kind of ironic one because I recently told my girlfriend \u201cI don\u2019t feel joy\u201d and I kind of mean it but in a way that I just don\u2019t get super excited about things. I can feel joy or happiness in the moment, I look forward to things in the future, but I rarely feel really *excited* about it.\\n\\nThe biggest one is probably playing D&D. It\u2019s a solid combo of creativity, fast thinking and social time. It\u2019s probably also one of the few things I could talk about for hours.\\n\\nI have a lot of practice talking about myself thanks to over 100 hours of therapy but I can\u2019t say that that\u2019s a topic that I\u2019m excited about. I also get very excited to eat take-out but couldn\u2019t talk about that for hours unless we\u2019re looking for recommendations.\\n\\nIt\u2019s funny because I do love to read, watch tv, play video games, and just consume media in general but I don\u2019t go out of my way to talk about it for more than a few minutes. I\u2019ve always been a big Solo Enjoyer.\\n\\n**Question 2: What do you do to get inspired? (5 things)**\\n* Read blogs / adventures written by other DMs (D&D)\\n* Stare out the window (in hopes of seeing animals)\\n* Listen to podcasts\\n* Look at my previous projects\\n* Talk about ideas with other people\\n\\n**Question 3: 3 artists that inspire your work**\\nI quickly knew this wasn\u2019t a question I was prepared to answer. Which made me wonder if maybe it\u2019s a reason why I feel all over the place with style. I don\u2019t have any artists I follow really closely or ones I\u2019ve done a deep dive on their methods. But I do have a Twitter list with 100 artists whose art I like. I can\u2019t say they all inspire my art. So it took a long time to find some answers to this:\\n\\n1. [Fran Dare](https://twitter.com/frandaredoodles)\\n\\nFran used to run #drowgust over on Twitter every year, it was one of the first art month challenges that I managed to complete. They draw an endless amount of drow (and so was I a few years ago) and I really loved their greyscale approach to traditional pieces. They are probably a big reason why I own so many grey markers.\\n\\n2. [Drawfee team](https://www.youtube.com/@Drawfee)\\n\\nDrawfee is a show that\u2019s been around online for ages but I only started watching it last year. They are digital art focused, which is often how I work. They mostly draw characters or silly scenes, which is basically where I want to get comfortable with my drawings. But since they do speedraws every now and then you can watch their process, hear about how they troubleshoot an image and see them push their own artistic boundaries. Watching their episodes every week is definitely one of the big reasons why I made this year an art focused year.\\n\\n3. ???\\n\\nHonestly couldn\u2019t come up with anyone else. Back in the days of DeviantArt and blogs it was much easier to follow artists and learn about their process. I\u2019m not a huge fan of historical artists so I\u2019m not off reading about the progression of the Old Masters. A decent take away from this question is that I probably want to find some time to do research on artists, see who has good YouTube content, see if anyone is blogging about their work. Learn more about other people\'s approaches to find new directions to take my own practice.\\n\\n## Inspiration and reference material\\n\\nLike most of the courses this one tasks you with creating a moodboard and even a playlist. Since the mood boards were focused on one for real animals and one for monsters I spent some time building these up with images I like. I didn\u2019t bother to make a playlist as I find this very time consuming and not super helpful to my own process.\\n\\nIt was around this point that I realised how many different assignments there were going to be in this course. There was a blob challenge, which I did. But she says don\u2019t even bother to do this unless you know you are then going to work on a larger piece after. And in my case, I almost never have that much time on my hands to spend 20 minutes doing a blob challenge. Followed by a requested **five** pages of sketches to get ideas down. Then on top of that, choosing 3-5 and giving those characters a story related phrase to say.\\n\\nI understand that this is a course very closely following a particular artist\'s approach to their work but at this point the course was losing focus for me. Wasn\u2019t jiving with the process. I wanted to get to the technical takeaways. I know this comes a lot from my own impatience, but it\u2019s also clear that these are approaches for people who can spend 2-5 hours doing creative projects. I don\u2019t have that kind of time so I need to find my own approach.\\n\\n## Warm-up\\n\\nI did the blob challenge twice. The first time when I had limited time and the second time on a rare quiet morning. I still really do enjoy this challenge, even though I often feel head empty when I first see the shapes. I\'m usually pretty pleased with one of them by the end of it.\\n\\n![Draw a creature in the blog exercise](/img/21-draw-img/Blob-exercise.jpg)\\n\\nThen I went to my Pinterest boards and started sketching. At first I would take one idea from each monster while scrolling. Other times I would attempt to reacted a whole creature if it felt like a good challenge. Then I stared to take single pieces and try to build up something larger just using my own ideas. Then I just drew some jellyfish.\\n\\n![Some of my practice sketches](/img/21-draw-img/mm-sketches.jpg)\\n\\nI chose the moth guy to be the piece of this course. Simple enough that I felt confident I could recreate it in a new sketch. But before that I had to drop 150$ on watercolour supplies. Just had too.\\n\\nI had tried using the Aquarelle Watercolour Pencils I already owned but found I still struggled with understanding the right way to use these. I probably could have looked up some tutorials online but other then a new sketchbook I hadn\'t bought any new art materials since started these classes 6 months ago. Felt like a reasonable time to put some money into the hobby, especially if it was going to help motivate me in a course.\\n\\n## Final project\\n\\nMoth guy, who I started to call Mothmon because I felt he had Digimon design energy, got researched and then painted. Snapped a photo and then brought the painting into Procreate.\\n\\n<img src={MothmonP} width=\\"400\\"/>\\n\\nIt\'s here that Eva\'s mix media technique really starts to shine. She\'s all about doing small adjustments and touch ups or additions that blend in with the existing piece. With the goal of making everything look like it could still be a traditional art piece. And choosing when to push past that line with some stronger digital techniques.\\n\\nThis is a very slow process, and I worked very zoomed in on the screen to try to keep the touchups subtle. But once I zoomed out and did a before and after comparison I started to feel pretty happy about how everything was coming together.\\n\\n<img src={MothmonS} width=\\"400\\"/>\\n\\n## Post course extracurriculars\\n\\nI put a few hours into touching up Mothmon before decided to call it quits on the piece. The most time I\'ve put into a work for a while. Since I was still riding the excitement of a new art supply purchase I returned to the new watercolours the next weekend to keep practicing how to use them.\\n\\nMaybe it was because this course was still fresh in my mind, but I stumbled across an illustrator who I found wildly inspiring just after finishing the Mothmon piece. [Josephine__Draws](https://www.instagram.com/josephine__draws/?hl=en) on Instagram. They do gorgeous monochrome pieces, mostly focused on animals, bones, and shells. They work with very strong lines while mixing in watercolour elements. The kind of stuff that makes me want to pick up a pencil and draw whenever I see it.\\n\\nThey sadly don\'t have much of an online presence beyond their Instagram page so I\'m going to have to survive on their short looping videos."},{"id":"digital-illustration","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/digital-illustration","source":"@site/blog/2023-06-28-digital-illustration.md","title":"The basics of illustrations","description":"I put off a lot of the full illustration classes, to me they feel like putting together all the bits you\u2019ve learned to try to make something more comprehensive.

For the 3rd row I decided to go with the character from one of my earlier lessons, Queza, who is rather squid-like so I didn\u2019t want to use her at first. But in the end it was nice to play around with a less human face.\\n\\n## Clothing and posing\\n\\nClothing has always been a weakness of mine, not because of folds and understanding fabric but because I don\u2019t have much creativity for designing outfits. I\u2019ll usually got with simple outfits, not too many layers. Or the classic cheat of; if I\u2019m comfortable with the figure I\u2019ve draw I\u2019ll put them in something fitting, if I\u2019m not comfortable with the proportions/figure I\u2019ll hide the body under something baggier.\\n\\nFor this homework I used an image from [Modern Wizard Apparel\'s Esty shop](https://www.etsy.com/ca/listing/1091751570/solid-array-wrap-wrap-vest-scarf-belted). I recently ordered a few pieces from there and love them, so you can take this as an endorsement.\\n\\n![Clothing practice](/img/21-draw-img/Illustration-homework-clothing.jpg)\\n\\nFor the posing homework, there was the fun suggestion have having three random curved lines and building a pose around that. I asked my girlfriend to draw three line and then had to deal with a terrifying N-like shape. I struggled with that one for a pretty long time but I\u2019m pretty happy with the dive pose I ended up on.\\n\\n![Pose practice](/img/21-draw-img/Illustration-homework-2.jpg)\\n\\n## The project\\n\\nSo one of my biggest weaknesses as a creative is that I\u2019m extremely impatient. One of the reasons I enjoy writing is because I can go really fast and feel good about having just written something down. When it comes to more physical hobbies like drawing or piano, I\u2019m too impatient to:\\n\\n1. Practice\\n2. Take my time when it\u2019s needed\\n\\nI\u2019m forcing the practice by taking all these courses. Just really trying to let myself be messy with art and try new things. Which is why I often do all the homework assignments. But for point 2, when it comes to \u201cputting something together at the end of the course\u201d I tend to just\u2026 not. This is partially because I just want to jump into something new and partially because I know it will take me hours of work to make anything I\u2019m really happy with. And these days I just don\u2019t know where I\u2019ll find hours of free time to put into a larger project.\\n\\nI did the thumbnailing part of the course, the first step of starting an illustration. Even came up with a few ideas I liked:\\n\\n![Illustration thumbnails for a Queza piece](/img/21-draw-img/queza-thumbnails.jpg)\\n\\nBut the thought of having to commit to one just didn\u2019t appeal to me. I put some time into trying to start one of them as a more serious piece, got distracted looking up fish brushes for Clip Studio, didn\u2019t know how to design the 2nd character, and then gave up. A whole illustration just feels a little out of my reach still. Partially because I didn\u2019t find that this course to provided too much in terms of foundational steps or approaches to things like backgrounds or styling. A bit of \u201cand then draw a background\u201d, which isn\u2019t where I\u2019m at yet. This is about as much progress as this piece will ever see:\\n\\n![Queza and a fish tank](/img/21-draw-img/Queza-illu.jpg)\\n\\n## The illustrations\\n\\nI gave illustration another shot when I went camping for a few days. This time I wanted to focus more on the steps and not coming up with a scene on my own so I used [this image as a reference](https://www.pinterest.ca/pin/697495061015057710). There\u2019s a fair bit of photography on these cormorant fishermen which are extremely beautiful. And it\'s a testament to how terrible the internet is these days that I can\'t verify who the exact photographer of the image I linked is. A curse I blame Pinterest for. A possible source (and some history behind the fishing practice), can be read about here: [Interview: Travel Photographer Highlights China\u2019s Traditional Cormorant Fishing](https://mymodernmet.com/peter-yan-travel-photography-china/).\\n\\nThis one felt a little promising at the start, felt like I was capturing the pose in the sketch and I liked how the background looked when I just laid down 4 different colours for the major shapes/features. That feeling didn\u2019t last too long once I got into the inking.\\n\\n![Side by side comparison](/img/21-draw-img/Fisherman-progress-shot1.png)\\n\\nIt\u2019s still hard for me to find time to focus on art fully, all I was really getting (on my vacation week!) was 20 minutes when I got into bed. I feel different about it every time I open it up, and have a running list of things I want to improve. But I\u2019m already at the point of \u201ceven if I finish this I\u2019m not going to be happy with it\u201d so I\u2019m ready to toss it.\\n\\n![Final fisherman progress shot](/img/21-draw-img/Fisherman-wip.jpg)\\n\\nI know pushing through is probably what\u2019s going to help me learn and become more comfortable with larger works but doing full colour, large digital illustrations isn\u2019t really my end goal when it comes to art so I\u2019m less invested in improving in that area right now."},{"id":"bean-approach","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/bean-approach","source":"@site/blog/2023-06-15-bean-approach.md","title":"Drawing cute creatures with beans","description":"After feeling pretty disappointed by the first creature course, I was excited after watching the introduction to \u2018Designing Fun Animal Characters\u2019 by Rodgon.

His approach made sense to me right from the start.\\n\\n1. Figure out the stand out physical features of a creature\\n2. Work from a simple base\\n3. Put those stand out features on the simple base\\n\\nAfter enjoying my tiny goat lesson from earlier in the year, I was hype to get back to drawing animals again.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## Creature features\\n\\nDid a few random animal sketches to warm up. Asking my girlfriend to name an animal, I would Google it, and then try to draw it. Resulted in some basic little guys but the animals happened to not have the easiest features to capture.\\n\\n![Some random creatures as warm ups.](/img/21-draw-img/animal-sketches1.jpg)\\n\\n## The bean approach\\n\\nAfter spending some time looking at animals and trying to figure out what makes them stand out, it was time to get to the base of our future creatures; the bean bag. Or as I took to referring to it; the beans.\\n\\nThe exercise started off pretty simple, make some bean shapes and then draw contour lines around them to understand the 3D shape of the bean bag aka future creature. This is to help add the feature after and to just have a better grasp of the space being occupied by the bean.\\n\\nI was pretty happy with my lined beans by the end of it.\\n\\n![My lined beans floating in space.](/img/21-draw-img/blank-beans.jpg)\\n\\nNext we moved on to adding the features. I tried to get as many random animal references as possible. Which resulted with me pulling cards out of this box\u2019s \u2018Biology\u2019 section to get an animal at random. Some beans turned out better than others. But even the messy ones helped me realize how I\u2019d approach that animal differently on a second go.\\n\\n![Some beans that kind of look like creatures.](/img/21-draw-img/IMG_0124.jpg)\\n\\n## Technicalities of technology\\n\\nThe rest of the course was more focused on important information you\u2019d want to know if you were to pursue digital art professionally. Rodgon went over file sizes, what they mean, when to save as certain file types and what to be aware of when designing for specific requests.\\n\\nHe spent a long time showing us his inking process in Adobe Illustrator which was rather eye opening to me. I\u2019d only ever opened the program once or twice before and had no idea how to use it. Seeing how the inking is so different from other digital art programs was pretty inspiring. Looked like a fun way to approach the task. So it\u2019s a shame I don\u2019t ever see myself forking over the money to Adobe to try it out for myself.\\n\\nOverall it was interesting to see a full piece come together that\u2019s pretty different from the other lessons I\u2019d followed so far that also included one piece going from sketches to completion. And I like how Rodgon shares super practical tips and approaches. Looking forward to drawing many bean shapes in my future.\\n\\n## A non art course interlude\\n\\nSo on top of trying to do 1-2 art courses a month, I have also signed up for a 5 week program on cephalopods. This is a weekly lecture through Atlas Obscura which I just thought would be fun. I also thought it would be helpful to learn more ocean creature facts for my Underwater D&D campaign. Which has already started to pay off.\\n\\nInstead of taking notes during the course I tried to focus on sketching some of the creatures the teacher shared. So these are my sketches from lesson one.\\n\\n![Cuttle fish, squids, and octopuses.](/img/artwork/squid-class1.jpg)"},{"id":"storytelling-illustrations","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/storytelling-illustrations","source":"@site/blog/2023-05-27-storytelling-illustrations.md","title":"Storytelling with illustrations","description":"I managed to finished a a course at the start of May before Tears of the Kingdom came out, \u2018Telling a Story Through Illustration\u2019.","date":"2023-05-27T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"art","permalink":"/blog/tags/art"},{"inline":true,"label":"21draw","permalink":"/blog/tags/21-draw"}],"readingTime":3.64,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Kylie","title":"Admin","url":"https://github.com/kylies","imageURL":"https://github.com/kylies.png","key":"kylie","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"storytelling-illustrations","enableComments":true,"title":"Storytelling with illustrations","image":"/img/21-draw-img/POV-1.jpg","authors":["kylie"],"tags":["art","21draw"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Drawing cute creatures with beans","permalink":"/blog/bean-approach"},"nextItem":{"title":"April Art Projects","permalink":"/blog/stylized-characters"}},"content":"I managed to finished a a course at the start of May before Tears of the Kingdom came out, [\u2018Telling a Story Through Illustration\u2019](https://www.21-draw.com/my-course/?id=46594).\\n\\nI was a little intimidated by this course because the idea of doing full illustrations still feels very challenging to me. Make a scene, draw a background, manage areas of focus and lighting. All the parts of drawing in one. Which I feel like I\u2019ll never be ready for!\\n\\nThankfully this was another Tony Bancroft course and I\u2019ve come to love his approach and his assignments. As a classically trained animator he\u2019s focused on foundational aspects which is exactly what I still want to focus on.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## Frame and composition\\n\\nThe courses started off by talking about the frame (the area in which your art piece will exist) and composition. In my High School art classes composition was what the art teacher praised me for most. I didn\u2019t really understand what it meant back then, but I now think it means I had a pretty natural grasp of the use of space. This section had the mini assignment of creating different kinds of traditional compositions using only basic shapes.\\n\\n\\n![Quarters, thirds, split, and other composition types](/img/21-draw-img/Composition-1.jpg)\\n\\n## Horizon lines and your point of view\\n\\nThe next section covered different ways to layout a scene. Horizon lines are that line in an image that\u2019s usually the split between the ground and the sky. Tony shared examples on how different horizon line placements can dramatically change what\u2019s in focus in the scene or how they can be used to shift perspective.\\n\\nIn my two practice runs I tried a very high horizon line to have more space to work with a landscape. While in the second I tried a low and angled horizon line to show the size differences between the mouse and the cat while trying to create more dynamics with a tilted line.\\n\\n![Adding details to Style A](/img/21-draw-img/Composition-2.jpg)\\n\\nThe other assignment for this section was to Push You Point of View. Which means to move away from a flat scene where everything might have equal prominence to one that creates more depth by using a different point of view. The challenge provided was to draw a young girl looking up at a bird singing in a tree.\\n\\n1. Low POV looking up at the bird\\n2. High POV from the bird angled down\\n3. Flat POV where neither is in more focus\\n\\n![Point of view practice](/img/21-draw-img/POV-1.jpg)\\n\\nI really liked this as an exercise as I rarely push for different angles in my pieces but these quick sketches very easily show that the first two images are way more interesting composition wise than the last one.\\n\\n# Depth, lines, overlap\\n\\nThe rest of the course covered a few more tricks for creating a good composition.\\n\\nDepth: Work with foreground, middle, and background\\nLines of action: Use the lines of everything in the scene to point towards your focus area\\nOverlap: Overlap objects to create more depth and a more natural look\\n\\nMy first attempt at a scene using these tips, followed by pushing it with an up angle and down angle approach:\\n\\n![Adventurers in a dungeon](/img/21-draw-img/POV-2.png)\\n\\nAnd then a new piece to try to capture all the different parts of the course. I maybe only managed to get in directional lines and different depth levels. Directional lines were my main focus as I didn\u2019t use them as much in previous home works. And I find all the final \u201cnow put it all together and draw something\u201d assignments to easily feel overwhelming, it\u2019s difficult to think of something that feels like all the rules can be used. But the pros make it all look easy to bring the pieces together so I know it\u2019s possible, but my brain doesn\u2019t think in those processes just yet.\\n\\n![Mermaid for MerMay](/img/21-draw-img/Composition-3.jpg)\\n\\n## Next course\\n\\nI complained about the creature design course last time, but forgot to share that I did do the first assignment from it: drawing the skeletal and muscular structure of a creature.\\n\\n![Deer anatomy exercise](/img/21-draw-img/Deer-anatomy.jpg)\\n\\nThis was kind of fun and I can see it being helpful for doing more serious creature design. There\u2019s lots of different animal anatomy out there to learn! But instead I\u2019m going on to the \u2018Designing Fun Animal Characters\u2019 course to instead learn the much more simplified approach to creatures."},{"id":"stylized-characters","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/stylized-characters","source":"@site/blog/2023-05-21-stylized-characters.md","title":"April Art Projects","description":"In April I went through the course \u2018How to Stylize Characters\u2019.","date":"2023-05-21T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"art","permalink":"/blog/tags/art"},{"inline":true,"label":"21draw","permalink":"/blog/tags/21-draw"}],"readingTime":3.08,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Kylie","title":"Admin","url":"https://github.com/kylies","imageURL":"https://github.com/kylies.png","key":"kylie","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"stylized-characters","enableComments":true,"title":"April Art Projects","image":"/img/21-draw-img/style-a-blocks.jpg","authors":["kylie"],"tags":["art","21draw"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Storytelling with illustrations","permalink":"/blog/storytelling-illustrations"},"nextItem":{"title":"Adding character to characters","permalink":"/blog/expressive-design"}},"content":"In April I went through the course [\u2018How to Stylize Characters\u2019](https://www.21-draw.com/my-course/?id=42788).\\n\\nI wasn\u2019t sure what to expect from this course. \u201cStyle\u201d is a very nebulous thing, one that I\u2019ve been told over and over again will develop with time and mastery of the basics. The course ended up focusing more on how you can work in different styles by taking different approaches and really iterating on your ideas.\\n\\nThe teacher broke down each part of the course with very well focused assignments and practical steps. With the idea being to draw the same character to match two different use cases. He was working on developing a Frankenstein\u2019s Monster character while I made the mistake of choosing one of my own D&D characters who I\u2019ve iterated on a few times already. I say this was a mistake as choosing a fresh character would have given me more freedom to experiment instead of feeling locked in a previously established character design. But even with that mistake on my side I felt like I was able to learn a lot from the assignments.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## Start with the basics\\n\\nI went with the same use cases (aka briefs) that tee instructure went with as the two styles I\u2019d aim for:\\n* A 2D childrens cartoon vibe\\n* A 3D more grown up cartoon vibe\\n\\nStep one was to do silhouettes. This built on the silhouettes covered in the previous courses, where you want to make sure your main character features are able to stand out even when working with a pure black silhouette. For the 2D version the focus was on working with basic shapes; circles, squares, triangles, etc. Then doing some simple shaping on those. For the 3D version the approach was more freehand, blocking out shapes with fewer restrictions and more details.\\n\\n![Style A silhouettes](/img/21-draw-img/style-a-blocks.jpg)\\n\\nThis process was really challenging for me, I felt like I struggled to bring anything unique to each new form. Hell, barely felt like I could make a decent looking basic shape, they all looked so awkward! But with a bit of extra refinement in shape, I was able to settle on 3 to take to the next step.\\n\\n![Adding details to Style A](/img/21-draw-img/style-a-edits.jpg)\\n\\n## Onto Style B\\n\\nWith Style B being more free to freehand sketch I ended up falling into old patterns for this character. It was at this point that I felt like I had made a misstep in not choosing a fresh character to work with and didn\'t go much further with the exercise.\\n\\n![Style B sketches](/img/21-draw-img/style-b-drafts.jpg)\\n\\nWhile I didn\'t take either of the styles to completion, this was probably one of my favourite courses so far. The differences between approaches felt unique, the process that was shown to iterate through designs, and how to mix and match pieces you liked all just made sense when seeing them in practice.\\n\\nI can definitely see sitting down to go through this whole course again with a different character in mind.\\n\\n## On to the next one\\n\\nAfter this course I was very excited to start [\u2018Creature Design\u2019](https://www.21-draw.com/my-course/?id=2664) because I have a list of creatures I want to sketch out for my underwater D&D campaign. However, this course ended up being more like \u2018doing an illustration with a creature\u2019 and less about how to strategically approach designing your own creatures. I gave it a shot by sitting through 1 of it\u2019s 8 hours but felt like it wasn\u2019t worth my time.\\n\\nFeeling a little deflated by my first \u2018DNF\u2019 I didn\u2019t touch anything for a few weeks. I\'ve now found another course that\'s getting me excited to sit down and sketch so hoping to get back to more regular practice!"},{"id":"expressive-design","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/expressive-design","source":"@site/blog/2023-04-11-expressive-design.md","title":"Adding character to characters","description":"After a month focused more on digital art practices I decided to go with more challenging courses for April.

Not challenging on a technical level, but challenging because this has always been something I\'ve felt my own drawings have lacked; energy and expression.\\n\\nOne of the March courses touched on this a little, going into the importance of silhouette and body language. I felt like that course had a lot of practical advice that was easy to start bringing in to my sketches. So I wanted to find a course that would keep elaborating on these approaches. Ending up on one titled [\\"How to Bring You Characters to Life.\\"](https://www.21-draw.com/my-course/?id=4457&lesson_id=0)\\n\\nI wasn\'t sure what to expect from the course as I knew it would be different from the typical, here\'s how to understand anatomy that lots of art classes start with. Thankfully the instructor started by breaking down the main parts of a character that add life to an image.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## Hands and Eyes\\n\\n![Practicing different kinds of eyes](/img/21-draw-img/Eyes-emote.png)\\n\\nFirst came eyes, putting them on faces, playing around with eye brows. I think the big take away from this was just acknowledging how alive a shape can become with very simple eyes thrown on it.\\n\\n![Dreaded hands](/img/21-draw-img/hands-emote.jpg)\\n\\nLike many artists, I struggle with hands. Found a good reference sheet of hand photos to use for these sketches and I\'m actually pretty happy with most of them. Sure they aren\'t clean but they convey the shape I was aiming for in most cases. Which is more of the goal of this course in particular. Find the bare minimum to keep the message in the shapes.\\n\\n## Squash and squish\\n\\n![Squash and squish](/img/21-draw-img/Squash-squish.png)\\n\\nThis jump sequence was done to practice \'squash and squish\'. Terms that come from animation for how you manipulate bodies, faces, etc. to emphasize motion and expression. You tend to give yourself more leeway with anatomy while communicating the motion that\'s happening.\\n\\n![Facial expressions](/img/21-draw-img/expression-emote.jpg)\\n\\nSquash and squish come into play in expressions to show movement in the face to convey emotions. While I understand the simple pieces to this I struggle adapting expressions to characters as I feel like I lose what makes a character face unique. In this practice I tried to ignore that fear and just push the expressions as far as I could. Which did result in some pretty ridiculous looking faces.\\n\\n## Bringing it together\\n\\n![Gesture drawing](/img/21-draw-img/Gesture-drawing1.png)\\n\\nDid some full body gesture studies to try incorporating some of the tips that were covered. It\'s interesting to return to gesture drawing in every course while taking in the advice of new teachers each time.\\n\\nAfter all those exercises the final piece of homework was supposed to be to bring it all together in a character drawing. I started that but... made a bad choice of reference image that didn\'t offer much life.\\n\\n![Skril with a staff](/img/21-draw-img/Skril-wip-course.jpg)\\n\\nI then got hooked on wanting to work on this piece as I was actually pretty happy with parts of it and felt like I was making decent improvements every time I went back to it. But then I got stuck on hating the face and had the realization that I was no longer practicing the material covered in the course. So instead of pushing forward on the piece I closed Procreate and went to choose a new course to try again.\\n\\nStarted on a stylizing characters course a few days ago which pulls on a lot of the advice from this course so I\'m hoping that it will help cement a lot of what I picked up here while I continue trying to really figure out these foundational techniques."},{"id":"more-courses","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/more-courses","source":"@site/blog/2023-03-26-more-courses/2023-03-26.md","title":"March Lessons","description":"For March I tried out a few shorter courses, two focused on getting familiar with Procreate and one about bringing life to your poses.","date":"2023-03-26T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"art","permalink":"/blog/tags/art"},{"inline":true,"label":"21draw","permalink":"/blog/tags/21-draw"}],"readingTime":2.785,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Kylie","title":"Admin","url":"https://github.com/kylies","imageURL":"https://github.com/kylies.png","key":"kylie","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"more-courses","enableComments":true,"title":"March Lessons","authors":["kylie"],"tags":["art","21draw"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Adding character to characters","permalink":"/blog/expressive-design"},"nextItem":{"title":"Fungal February","permalink":"/blog/funguary-2023"}},"content":"For March I tried out a few shorter courses, two focused on getting familiar with Procreate and one about bringing life to your poses.\\n\\nThe Procreate ones were fun, focusing on creating a single piece from start to finish while learning some of Procreates key features. These tended to focus on portraits, which aren\'t usually my own focus but they\'re a good place to start.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## From pencil to Procreate\\n\\nCourse one was made by [Feefal](https://twitter.com/feefal_), the artist who ran #funguary last month. Her program starts with pencil and paper then bringing that over to Procreate to add colours. It was nice to work with physical objects again so I enjoyed working on paper to create the original outline for this piece.\\n\\n![Sketch of octogirl](/img/21-draw-img/octo-girl-sketch.jpg \\"First sketch\\")\\n\\nI also felt like she really showed how to mimic her style by using specific brushes and colouring techniques. She definitely uses a few approaches I never do so it was cool to push myself beyond my comfort zone and kind of trust her process.\\n\\nHaving just recently kicked off a new D&D campaign I knew I wanted to try and use my drawing time to create character art for future NPCs in the game. For this exercise I chose an octopus type person inspired by the [cephalid](https://www.mtggoldfish.com/price/Streets+of+New+Capenna/Queza+Augur+of+Agonies-showcase#paper) from Magic The Gathering. The end result doesn\'t look like something I would have reached on my own, so I\'m pretty happy that it feels like something new.\\n\\n![Sketch of octogirl](/img/21-draw-img/octo-girl.png \\"Final octo girl result\\")\\n\\n## Making expressive poses\\n\\nSince I got through that course in a weekend I quickly jumped into another: Drawing Character Poses with Personality. This one was pretty different from everything I\'d taken so far. For one, Tony Bancroft is a traditional animator who started the program with paper and pencil. It feels like he\'s coming from a background of animation and storytelling more then the previous teachers who felt like they specialized in character design and illustration.\\n\\nThe tricks and theory he taught were great. Really broke down some ideas that seemed complex into very digestible tips. He didn\'t have too many assignments during the course so I only have these few messy sketches:\\n\\n![Character expression practice](/img/21-draw-img/IMG_0088.png)\\n![Character expression practice](/img/21-draw-img/IMG_0089.png)\\n\\n## Back to Procreate\\n\\nAfter that theory focused, traditional approach I went back to another short Procreate lesson, this time by Erika Wiseman. This course was very similar to the first Procreate one I did, find inspiration on Pinterest, create a character, learn some Procreate tips.\\n\\nThere were a few techniques presented that I didn\'t care for and felt like they aren\'t great for refining technical skill so I didn\'t incorporate them into my sketching for the assignments. But I was very happy to learn the quick trick for making a layer for checking your values.\\n\\nI once again made things more difficult for myself by now drawing a human. Choosing instead to take some inspiration from magical looking owl creatures.

A yearly art challenged focused on making different types of mushrooms into creatures hosted by [@feefal_](https://twitter.com/feefal_).\\n\\nI stumbled across this challenge in December and kept it in mind for my year of art practice.\\n\\n>Funguary 2023 is soon upon us! A February drawing challenge based around fungi\ud83c\udf44\\n>Here are the rules and all the prompts for the month! -- feef (@feefal_)\\n\\n![The Funguary Challenge](/img/Funguary.png \\"The rules of Funguary.\\")\\n\\nA few years ago I was doing monthly challenges like this a few times a year. Those often meant drawing something new every day. For this challenge, I followed the suggested format of doing one a week to keep things more manageable.\\n\\nIn an attempt to make the process smoother for myself I spent time on Pinterest collecting images of all the suggested mushrooms for each week. With this reference collection I spent the first few days of the month sketching the mushrooms. I was hoping to do this for every week but it ended up taking more time then I expected.\\n\\n![Photo of my sketchbook](/img/artwork/mushroom-sketches.jpeg \\"Photo of my sketchbook, a page of mushrooms.\\")\\n\\nI also spent time doing thumbnails for a few of the weeks. I wanted to use that as a chance to push past my first idea and try out different compositions or concepts. But just like sketching mushroom, this took up a fair bit of my limited drawing time so towards the end I started to skip this step.\\n\\n![Simple thumbnails](/img/artwork/funguary-thumbnails.jpg \\"Some quick thumbnails for brainstorming.\\")\\n\\nThere were a lot of fun mushrooms discovered during this month so I was a little sad to only choose 4 to focus on. I did end up trying to fit in a few of the other ones in to a few of the projects. These are my 4 final pieces:\\n\\n![My 4 Funguary pieces](/img/artwork/all-fungals-2023.png \\"My four fungal friends.\\")\\n\\nI resisted doing any cute lady mushrooms as that was my first instinct. But it felt too easy to just turn all the mushrooms into dresses. I\'m not super happy with any of the pieces but there are parts that I like about all of them. I feel like #3 is decently creepy, I like how the shading came out on the body of #4 and I\'m shocked I tried to do a scene in #2. I regret not tracking how much time was put into each one as I know I kicked out the last one in one day while the first one took at least 3.\\n\\nOver the course of the month I did feel like I was improving and becoming more comfortable with Clip Studio Paint as time went on. It was nice to remember a few tricks to using the software too, proof that I hadn\'t forgotten everything I learned a few years ago.\\n\\nI don\'t think I\'ll do another challenge like this for a few months as it ate away at my actual art lesson time. But it was very nice to take a break from figure drawing humans all the time."},{"id":"getting-started","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/getting-started","source":"@site/blog/2023-02-12.md","title":"Getting started with 21Draw","description":"Towards the end of 2022 I had already started thinking of 2023 as a year I wanted to make more of an effort to get back into drawing.

I missed being creative and hated watching my large collection of expensive markers slowly dry out and die.\\n\\nWhile browsing Twitter one night I saw an artist I followed had recently published an art course on [21Draw](https://www.21-draw.com/). I\'d never heard of the website before and was surprised to see that it was possibly the perfect fit for my 2023 goals. Online art lessons focused on core skills and even digital tools I was already familiar with.\\n\\nI don\'t usually like buying something as soon as I see it but I got sucked in by the countdown clock at the top of the page promoting an End of Year Discount. 2 subscriptions for 1/3rd the price of a normal signal subscription. And I only had 5 hours left to take advantage!\\n\\nSo anyway, 30 minutes after finding the site I was registered and ready to go with a whole year of access.\\n\\nWhile I was very excited to get to the courses focused on character design, Clip Studio, and Procreate, I forced myself to choose a beginner course as my first lesson. Then after the first lesson to stick to some core lessons like anatomy and perspective. So basically figure drawing all the time.\\n\\n![Screenshot of the course page](/img/21-draw-img/figure-drawing-class.png \\"Figure drawing class\\")\\n\\nI\'m now entering month two and I\'m finding my time to devote to course material fading. Balancing two D&D campaigns, other hobbies, and drawing is still a struggle. But thanks to the February drawing challenged called #Funguary over on Twitter I\'m still putting in some drawing time every few days. Just a little less focused then I\'d like it to be. I\'ll talk about #Funguary in my next post.\\n\\nHoping that in March I\'ll have more then just a few figure drawing sketches to share."},{"id":"welcome","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/welcome","source":"@site/blog/2023-02-11-welcome/index.md","title":"Welcome","description":"Hi!","date":"2023-02-11T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":true,"label":"art","permalink":"/blog/tags/art"}],"readingTime":0.455,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Kylie","title":"Admin","url":"https://github.com/kylies","imageURL":"https://github.com/kylies.png","key":"kylie","page":null}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"welcome","enableComments":true,"title":"Welcome","authors":["kylie"],"tags":["art"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Getting started with 21Draw","permalink":"/blog/getting-started"}},"content":"Hi!\\n\\nThis blog is going to be used to document my Return To Art.\\n\\nI used to draw regularly, then I returned to working full time and the hobby died while I was busy doing a capitalism.
