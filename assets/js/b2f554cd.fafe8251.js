Kind of in a small way, kind of in a big way. For this week I chose goblins.\\n\\nNow it\u2019s kind of just like doing another creature, except it has humanoid anatomy and it\u2019s well, not real. There are no real life photographs to learn from for fictional creatures. I wasn\u2019t sure exactly how I was going to deal with this lack when I started the week but I feel like I found a decent formula.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## Day 1 - Drawing from imagination\\n\\nDay 1 was just like other day ones. I had just recently put together my Pinterest board of goblins so they were decently fresh in my head when I sat down to do this.\\n\\n![](/img/wap/wap-6.1.jpg)\\n\\nStill have that usual day 1 messiness but there was one standout face for me.\\n\\n![](/img/wap/wap-6.1.2.jpg)\\n\\nThis guy surprises me, one of those \u201cdid I draw that??\u201d moments. It\u2019s not like it\u2019s overly complicated but I would usually need to be looking at a reference to get down that face shape!\\n\\n## Day 2 - Figure sketching\\n\\nFor this day 2 I didn\u2019t use photographs but instead tried to pull from my whole Pinterest board. I jumped around from image to image, whichever caught my attention. With a goal of trying out very different goblin styles.\\n\\n![Goblin sketches using references.](/img/wap/wap-6.2.jpg)\\n\\nI had hoped to be able to put together a bit of a visual history of goblins and identify current goblin media designs, but Pinterest wasn\u2019t super great at providing that selection. The big ones that came to mind were Magic the Gathering goblins and D&D goblins. Then throw in some cartoon goblins like the ones from Adventure Time. This is probably a do-able project but it would have taken many more days than the hour or so I gave myself to collect references and read the Wikipedia page on goblin origins.\\n\\n## Day 3 - Reference studies\\n\\nFor day 3 I took my favourite little guys from day 2 and spent more time on them. Tried to look critically at face shape, general body proportions, and ears. These are the standout goblin qualities to me.\\n\\n![](/img/wap/wap-6.3.jpg)\\n\\nThese three felt like they covered different vibes well. I flubbed the very cartoon guys as I tried to push myself on that one instead of re-creating since they had such simple shapes. Maybe not so simple after all\u2026\\n\\nThe ones in red are what I did after the main three. Trying to merge things together and try to identify what kind of vibe I wanted to bring to my own goblin style.\\n\\n## Day 4 - Style studies\\n\\nNow day 4 is usually style study, but I had basically done that on day 3. I didn\u2019t want to come out of this week having just ripped off someone else\u2019s goblin design so for day 4 I wanted to try out creature design.\\n\\nI chose my main contenters from day 3 (leaving out simple blob goblin as the first 2 felt like they would make more fitting D&D art). I then found some reference poses, sketched out that wireframe, tripled the frame and drew the same pose 3 times. Times 2 as I did the exercise twice.\\n\\nThe first one was my fave little grumpy guy. I\u2019m very in love with his huge lower jaw. The second guy has great years and a very simple face that looked good on everything. The 3rd one is me taking my favourite parts of the first two and trying to create something new.\\n\\n![](/img/wap/wap-6.4.jpg)\\n\\nFound a middle ground for the ears, mouth from one, nose from the other. Clothing ended up being a bit of a combo and I still don\u2019t love it but this wasn\u2019t a clothing challenge so I let it slide for the exercise.\\n\\nOverall I\u2019m happy with my 3rd form guy. While it doesn\u2019t feel like the most unique thing in the world, I knew that once I took this design into day 5 I would likely start to deviate even further from my references.\\n\\nReference: Grumpy goblin: This one was impossible to find due to the internet being flooded with Baby Yoda art.

Poses wasn\u2019t my area of study for the week and I didn\u2019t want to waste too much time troubleshooting poses when what I was really focused on was character design.\\n\\n![](/img/wap/wap-6.5.jpg)\\n\\nI\u2019m pretty happy with how the goblin guys turned out! The central design didn\u2019t changes too much but I have started to second guess the big ears. I\u2019m also struggling with how to handle the large mouth from multiple angles so that might be a long term project. Playing around with expression would also be fun.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nWith our iPad being on life support I returned to my Huion and I think I\u2019m really coming around to sketching with it. I\u2019ve warmed up to the default CSP pencils and now really like how they make sketches look.\\n\\nWhile there was the extra struggle this week of having to alter the daily programming, I feel like I landed somewhere near typical character design. I could have played with shape language more, and pushed things harder on clothing and expressions but still trying to keep these daily practices fairly focused to avoid feeling overwhelmed.\\n\\nThis week I even spent time inking and colouring one of my practice guys from day 4 instead of day 5 because I was already pretty happy which what I was producing.\\n\\n![](/img/wap/wap-6.4.2.jpg)\\n\\nNext week I\u2019ll return to a more traditional subject: rabbits.\\n\\n[Pinterest board of goblins.](https://www.pinterest.ca/maeanu3639/wap-goblin/)"},{"id":"wap-5","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/wap-5","source":"@site/blog/2024-02-04-week5-wap.md","title":"Weekly Art Practice - Week 5","description":"Week 5 - Hair styles","date":"2024-02-04T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"February 4, 2024","tags":[{"label":"art","permalink":"/blog/tags/art"}],"readingTime":4.455,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Kylie","title":"Admin","url":"https://github.com/kylies","imageURL":"https://github.com/kylies.png","key":"kylie"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Weekly Art Practice - Week 5","description":"Week 5 - Hair styles","slug":"wap-5","enableComments":true,"authors":["kylie"],"tags":["art"],"Image":"/img/wap/wap-5.3.2.jpg"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Weekly Art Practice - Week 6","permalink":"/blog/wap-6"},"nextItem":{"title":"January extras","permalink":"/blog/january-extras"}},"content":"This is another week where I wanted to push the boundaries of the format. A large part of drawing practice is to get more ideas into your head, basically to build a shape library. So my goal with this week\u2019s focus was twofold: broaden my mental library of hair styles and also find ways to convey hairstyles as minimally as possible.\\n\\nAfter 5 days of it, I\u2019m not sure how I feel.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## Day 1 - Drawing from imagination\\n\\nDay 1 as usual was pretty messy. Put down some vague head shapes and attempted to think of hair styles I know. This day is always a little difficult because you come up against the blank page of your mind. The classic moment of \u201chave I even seen hair before?\u201d when you try to mentally form an image in your head.\\n\\n![](/img/wap/wap-5.1.jpg)\\n\\n## Day 2 - Figure sketching\\n\\nDay 2 went a little better, the gift of being able to look at references. But this leads to falling into the hair trap: Drawing too many lines.\\n\\nI\u2019ve done hair tutorials before, I know that for drawing detailed hair you want to break it down into sections and try to just draw those sections, add minimal individual strands at the end to add a few fly aways or play with the shape. I find this very hard to do when working from a photo reference as hair is so messy. And the more time I spend on them the more lines I keep adding.\\n\\n![Quick hand sketches using references](/img/wap/wap-5.2.jpg)\\n\\n## Day 3 - Reference studies\\n\\nThis day is supposed to be spending more time with the photo references but that just means adding more strands and making more of a mess :\u2019) I\u2019m not sure why this week feels like it\u2019s going so bad but I\u2019m starting to feel like hair styles may have been too big of a topic. I possibly could have tried a sub theme, like up-dos or long or lose hair. By just trying to do a large variety of hair styles I didn\u2019t feel like I could focus on learning a few tricks to pull off something specific.\\n\\n![](/img/wap/wap-5.3.1.jpg)\\n\\n![](/img/wap/wap-5.3.2.jpg)\\n\\n![](/img/wap/wap-5.3.3.jpg)\\n\\n![](/img/wap/wap-5.3.4.jpg)\\n\\n\\n## Day 4 - Style studies\\n\\nWhen choosing styles to study I very much focused on simplified cartoon styles. Stayed away from over the top anime styles and didn\u2019t want anything super realistic. But I worry this has led to almost too much simplification and I\u2019d like to find a style somewhere in the middle.\\n\\nI tried using only forward facing faces for this day to make myself think of the hair style from a slightly different but consistent angle.\\n\\n![](/img/wap/wap-5.4.1.jpg)\\n\\nReference: The original link to this one on Instagram seems to be dead [but found a reference to it here.](https://beautifuldawndesigns.net/how-to-draw-hair-step-by-step-tutorials/)\\n\\n![](/img/wap/wap-5.4.2.jpg)\\n\\nReference: [ABD Illustrates](https://abd-illustrates.tumblr.com/)\\n\\n![](/img/wap/wap-5.4.3.jpg)\\n\\nI think this is the middle ground cartoon style I like most. But when looking at these a lot of the bangs and overall styles were a little too un-realistic to me. The artist does say they were exploring futuristic hairstyles so I don\'t think they are supposed to be the most realistic styles out there.\\n\\nReference: []@Cheriiart on Twitter](https://twitter.com/cheriiart/status/1187823921938092032)\\n\\n![](/img/wap/wap-5.4.4.jpg)\\n\\nThis is probably the most simplified style out of all of them. Mostly just the exterior lines to show the shape of the hair.\\n\\nReference: This is my first full failure to find a reference source. This image has been pinned on Pinterest so many times I can\'t find a non-Pinterest source. One source was a video so it might be from a TikTok????\\n\\n\\n## Day 5 - Drawing from imagination\\n\\nWhile I often feel a little bit of fear on day 5, this is the time I probably feared it the most. Partially because I didn\u2019t feel like I had any big insightful moments during my reference or style study days. And additionally because I didn\u2019t come up with a way to make the \u201cfinal project\u201d more engaging than drawing shapes on mannequin heads. So I did a few sheets.\\n\\n![](/img/wap/wap-5.5.1.jpg)\\n\\nThese left me feeling rather underwhelmed so I stopped for the day and let myself ruminate on it for a little longer. The next day I sat down and tried to do something a little more directed, which led to you getting to play a Guess That Hair game.\\n\\n![](/img/wap/tng_hair.jpg)\\n\\nI did look at references for this as the challenge wasn\u2019t just to draw hair but to get it close enough to be able to guess the character just by the hair style. While I don\u2019t feel like this is an overly impressive piece by any means, I am happy that they are all clear to me at a glance. So while I don\u2019t feel confident in my mental library of hair styles I do feel like I\u2019ve found some confidence in translating hair styles into a simplified art style.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nI think my lesson for this week is that not all subjects can be covered in a week. While I kind of came to the same conclusion with hands I at least felt like I made progress there while with hair I feel like I just scratched the surface. My biggest takeaway is that I really enjoyed drawing coily hair, it has such a great shape and variety to it.\\n\\n[Pinterest board of hair.](https://www.pinterest.ca/maeanu3639/wap-hair-refs/)"},{"id":"january-extras","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/january-extras","source":"@site/blog/2024-02-01-january-extras.md","title":"January extras","description":"A few pieces completed in January","date":"2024-02-01T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"February 1, 2024","tags":[{"label":"art","permalink":"/blog/tags/art"}],"readingTime":3.815,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Kylie","title":"Admin","url":"https://github.com/kylies","imageURL":"https://github.com/kylies.png","key":"kylie"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"January extras","description":"A few pieces completed in January","slug":"january-extras","enableComments":true,"authors":["kylie"],"tags":["art"],"Image":"/img/artwork/esior.jpg"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Weekly Art Practice - Week 5","permalink":"/blog/wap-5"},"nextItem":{"title":"Weekly Art Practice - Week 4","permalink":"/blog/wap-4"}},"content":"The weekly art practice posts are taking up a large portion of my creative time but I\u2019m still working on other pieces alongside them. A classic instance of the more time you spend doing a hobby the more you want to do it. The near daily art practice is helping me feel \u201cwarmed up\u201d most days, I don\u2019t feel like I need to ease into art every time I want to start something new now. Still rather shocked at how much I\u2019m making.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## Courses\\n\\nCourses aren\u2019t my big focus for this year but I\u2019ve done 2 small little focused things so far.\\n\\n### Domestika course: Illustrating Fantastical Animals with Procreate\\n\\n[Julia K\xf6rner](https://www.domestika.org/en/courses/3163-illustrating-fantastical-animals-with-procreate) is an artist I found on Instagram and saw she had a Domestika course. This was one of the main things that tempted me into a Domestika subscription. I was curious to see what went into her pieces that made them so soft and light.\\n\\nThe course ended up being a pretty typical \u201cfollow-along\u201d of the kinds I had done a bunch of on 21Draw. The key takeaways being what kind of brushes an artist uses to get their effects and how do they texture or use light. I attempted to follow her flow when working on this piece of a kobold submarine captain from my current D&D campaign.\\n\\n![An orange kobold holding a large wrench](/img/artwork/esior.jpg)\\n\\nI\u2019m decently happy with how this one came together, used a few shading techniques that I don\u2019t often do and I like how soft everything looks in the end. Though I can\u2019t say I feel like I have any confidence in being able to draw any more like K\xf6rner does by the end of the course. Her unique approach to animals is still very goals.\\n\\n### Live Drawclass\\n\\nI\u2019ve shared a link to a Drawfee Drawclass before, this time I upgraded my Patreon tier and followed one live. The videos are usually posted a month or so after they happen so this one on Character Design should be on YouTube soon.\\n\\nI was a little disappointed that there wasn\u2019t a clear process or steps explained as I\u2019m a very steps oriented person. Just throwing stuff down or working through multiple ideas isn\u2019t something that helps me focus. But it was still helpful to listen for the two hours and try to apply what was being talked about to my own sketches during the class time.\\n\\nI tried out Jacob\u2019s first character in a different pose and then simply copied the face he drew. He started with the idea of \u201ctired eyes\u201d which is something I hadn\u2019t tried before so I just wanted to see if I could pull off the same look.\\n\\n![](/img/artwork/drawclass1.jpg)\\n\\nIn the second part I tried to approach the prompt on my own. A plucky sidekick for the first character.\\n\\n![](/img/artwork/drawclass2.jpg)\\n\\n\\n## More D&D art\\n\\nThis is a digital re-draw of a piece I did probably 3-4 years ago now. I decided to use them as a character in my current underwater D&D campaign. I had them planned for a year before even starting the campaign, and I knew I wanted a new version of the piece to show the players for when the reveal would happen. It took almost a year of running the campaign before I even got to that reveal and I still didn\u2019t finish this piece 2 months before I shared it in game.\\n\\n![A drider hiding behind a large colourful crystal.](/img/artwork/yirrekeb.jpg)\\n\\n## Website icons\\n\\nThese were a headache. I had tried learning vector art many months ago now and failed to produce anything I was happy with. In my first attempt I was trying to re-create icons I had drawn in a regular art program. These ended up being too detailed and had too many colours to keep the svg format happy. I got frustrated and gave up on them.\\n\\nThis time around I was going to go in fresh. Which meant finding/learning a new program that would do svgs and choosing new ideas. I ended up using Linearity Curve for the iPad and it wasn\u2019t terrible. It even had a \u201ccovert to vector\u201d-like feature that you could do to any image. I did this for one royalty free squirrel photo I found, which became icon number one. Then I traced over messy sketches for squirrel 2 and the crow.\\n\\n![](/img/3icons.jpg)\\n\\nI probably should have done 3 squirrels or something to better convey what each section is but I wasn\u2019t loving the process. Maybe someday I\u2019ll revisit vectors but they just really aren\u2019t my speed."},{"id":"wap-4","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/wap-4","source":"@site/blog/2024-01-26-week4-wap.md","title":"Weekly Art Practice - Week 4","description":"Week 4 - Hands","date":"2024-01-26T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"January 26, 2024","tags":[{"label":"art","permalink":"/blog/tags/art"}],"readingTime":5.555,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Kylie","title":"Admin","url":"https://github.com/kylies","imageURL":"https://github.com/kylies.png","key":"kylie"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Weekly Art Practice - Week 4","description":"Week 4 - Hands","slug":"wap-4","enableComments":true,"authors":["kylie"],"tags":["art"],"Image":"/img/wap/wap-4.3.3.jpg"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"January extras","permalink":"/blog/january-extras"},"nextItem":{"title":"Weekly Art Practice - Week 3","permalink":"/blog/wap-3"}},"content":"Honestly surprised that this is 4 for 4 this month. Maybe I can do a blog post every week. Though I suspect committing to extremely minimal social time for January and my workplace being a disaster has contributed to having enough time to pull it off.\\n\\nAnyway, I hope you like looking at hands. I don\u2019t find them as exciting as pigeons or squirrels but after a few weeks of easy-ish creatures I wanted to try something that would be a serious push. And which would be applicable to more art pieces. I have an animation I\u2019ve been working on that\u2019s taken twice as long because of how much time I\u2019ve spent fighting with the hands. Ended up going with a very blob like shape in the end just to keep making progress. Time to see if a week of hands can carry me through drawing more hands in the future.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## Day 1 - Drawing from imagination\\n\\nThe first thing I noticed about this week is that it\u2019s difficult to draw hands *without* a reference. They are right there, doing the work, you can\u2019t look away. I tried my best to not do any posing or staring at my hands for too long in hopes of forcing my brain to think of the shapes itself.\\n\\n![Rough hand sketches in a notebook.](/img/wap/wap-4.1.jpg)\\n\\n## Day 2 - Speed sketching\\n\\nDay two I gave myself more freedom to look at local hands while also using some references.\\n\\n![Quick hand sketches using references](/img/wap/wap-4.2.jpg)\\n\\n## Day 3 - Reference Drawing\\n\\nNow with more serious references in play, I\u2019ve come to the conclusion that we shouldn\u2019t render hands too much. When you start looking at the specific details and shapes fingers make in photos, they sometimes translate terribly when putting them to paper. There\u2019s also just so many wrinkles and curves that it\u2019s easy for a hand to become muddy very quickly.\\n\\n![](/img/wap/wap-4.3.1.jpg)\\n\\nThere were 9 hands here but I just went with one or else this could have been the only reference image I needed. Thumb up seemed like a nice starting point. Keep most of the fingers partially hidden.\\n\\n![](/img/wap/wap-4.3.2.jpg)\\n\\nFingers coming towards the camera has always been a weakness of mine. I find it very difficult to convey the depth in a hand so that each finger is still readable.\\n\\n![](/img/wap/wap-4.3.3.jpg)\\n\\nAnother coming towards the camera one, proof I was trying to challenge myself. This hand is one of the ones that helped me see how strangely angular hands can be.\\n\\n![](/img/wap/wap-4.3.4.jpg)\\n\\nAnd then holding a ball. Often if I\u2019m doing a character drawing the character is often holding or touching something so object interaction is a pretty important shape to practise for me.\\n\\n## Day 4 - Style study\\n\\nAfter my conclusion of \u201ctoo much detail = bad\u201d I was excited to get some ideas for simple approaches. I\u2019m often drawing hands on small characters where the hand isn\u2019t the focus but is often trying to communicate something. I just need enough details for it to be clear what kind of action the hand is doing.\\n\\n![](/img/wap/wap-4.4.1.jpg)\\n\\nStarted with fingers. Seems to make sense to start with the small part of a bigger object. I\u2019m pretty familiar with the tube or sausages approach to drawing fingers but this was the first time I saw it done with a variety of perspectives.\\n\\nReference: [Screenshot from a how to draw hands vide](https://www.proko.com/course-lesson/how-to-draw-hands-details-for-realistic-hands/assignments).\\n\\n![](/img/wap/wap-4.4.2.jpg)\\n\\nI enjoy the box breakdown of hands, really helps to keep the 3D shape of the hand. But as I worked on these I did start to feel like they were too realistic to really be a style study.\\n\\nReference: [Tweet](https://twitter.com/GY_ANIFORCE/status/1207239639389466625).\\n\\n![](/img/wap/wap-4.4.3.jpg)\\n\\nNow here are some hands that really embrace the angular-ness of fingers! Each finger looks so strong and expressive. But look at them the wrong way and I get confused at what I\u2019m looking at.\\n\\nReference: [Kiwi Byrd Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/posts/16945474).\\n\\n![](/img/wap/wap-4.4.4.jpg)\\n\\nI fell in love with this style. So sleek and simple but so expressive. The lines are easy to draw after a few tries and it just felt good. I didn\u2019t commit to carrying this style through all my other practices but it\u2019s definitely something filed away in my mind now.\\n\\nReference: [Dom \\"Scruffy\\" Murphy on ArtStation](https://www.artstation.com/artwork/0XmZAe).\\n\\n![](/img/wap/wap-4.4.5.jpg)\\n\\nI caught this one last minute on Pinterest right before I started my drawing session. It was a style different from the other 2 previous ones, more cartoony, which was very much something I wanted to try. Just get even simpler but also rounder and cuter. It makes the hands stand out less but possibly easier to execute.\\n\\nI was enjoying these so I took some photos and tried to adapt those poses with the style.\\n\\nReference: [Freepik](https://www.freepik.com/premium-vector/child-hand-poses-vol-2_3014642.htm).\\n\\n## Day 5 - Drawing from imagination, take 2\\n\\nTest day. After my coloured pigeon piece from last week I decided that I wanted to do something like that as a final project of sorts for each theme. So I started day 5\u2019s drawing time with some sketches, mostly trying to capture the styles that I had practiced the day before.\\n\\n![](/img/wap/wap-4.5.1.jpg)\\n\\nThen I wanted to do something a little more detailed. Something that could be part of a larger piece where maybe the focus of the illustration is on the hands.\\n\\n![](/img/wap/wap-4.5.2.jpg)\\n\\nMy girlfriend says this looks like a tattoo design and after she said it I could see it. Add a bit more ling definition to the flame and it could be a weird clavicle piece.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nIt will get tedious to keep saying \u201cI\u2019m shocked at how much 4 days of practice does!\u201d it does still feel like that every day 5. I honestly enjoy drawing hands but do find it difficult. I think a big part of learning from this week was once again to embrace very simplified styles. And maybe adopt a drawing approach of continuous practice\u2026\\n\\nI\u2019m happy that this week wasn\u2019t as hard as I feared. It didn\u2019t feel overly difficult compared to the creatures from before. And having pages full of floating hands looks pretty cool.\\n\\nLater today I\u2019m attending an online art lesson on the character design process by one of the Drawfee hosts, so I might have a project to blog about from that. I also have a few other fully coloured pieces from the last few months that I haven\u2019t included anywhere. And my attempts at vector art to be the new icons for this site. So I may have multiple posts over the next few weeks.

Love to see him, love when they awkwardly try to cling to the trellis.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## Day 1 - Drawing from imagination\\n\\nDay one wasn\u2019t too intimidating. The hardest part is trying to not fall into the habits of drawing other birds. I drew a lot of birds of prey as a kid but pigeons have very little in common with raptors. So I find myself struggling with their longer necks and small beaks.\\n\\nMy pigeons ended up looking more like chickens.\\n\\n![First pigeon sketches.](/img/wap/wap-3.1.jpg)\\n\\n## Day 2 - Figure sketching\\n\\nAs usual I think I\u2019m maybe spending too much time on these. I need to get better at setting a timer to limit myself to 2-3 minutes per reference or else I fall into doing more fully reference sketches.\\n\\n![Quick pigeon sketches using references](/img/wap/wap-3.2.jpg)\\n\\n## Day 3 - Reference studies\\n\\nIt\u2019s hard to resist just drawing pigeons in ball form. Love when they bury their head in their big neck and poof up. But I managed to resist and try a few other poses. I also tried to play around a bit with colour here but didn\u2019t want that to be a big focus.\\n\\n![](/img/wap/wap-3.3.1.jpg)\\n\\nSimple start, standing in profile. Probably could have spent more time on this one but I tend to start fast and then slowly put more time into each reference practice piece.\\n\\n![](/img/wap/wap-3.3.2.jpg)\\n\\nThe prettiest pigeon! While I have focused on rock doves for my reference I chose this one for it\u2019s more unique pose and colours.\\n\\n![](/img/wap/wap-3.3.3.jpg)\\n\\nFluff! Fluff! As much as I love them I struggle to make them round enough. Need to \u201cpush the pose\u201d when the pose is \u201cbe a circle\u201d.\\n\\n![](/img/wap/wap-3.3.4.jpg)\\n\\nWings are still a challenge when you don\u2019t want to draw 100 feathers but also don\u2019t want to do an empty block shape.\\n\\n\\n## Day 4 - Style studies\\n\\nThere are a lot of good stylized pigeons out there. I try to choose a variety of them to see some different approaches. Thankfully pigeons aren\u2019t super complicated body-wise, but I feel like it\u2019s still hard to capture their cute-ness.\\n![](/img/wap/wap-3.4.1.jpg)\\n\\nSome nice simple guys here. They make the pigeon feel a little more fluid.\\n\\nReference: [iStock](https://www.istockphoto.com/vector/set-of-gray-doves-in-motion-gm962270904-262804925)\\n![](/img/wap/wap-3.4.2.jpg)\\n\\nSuch confident shapes!

Piece by [Tinysnails](https://www.instagram.com/p/BfHhqLqnJ0I/?taken-by=tinysnails)\\n![](/img/wap/wap-3.4.3.jpg)\\n\\nI love when pigeons are balls. This one just felt very expressive with a very simple shape. I made the beak too large on mine but I still find it very cute. I don\u2019t have the instinct to add the little shiver lines like on the top of this guy but it adds so much on the original.\\n\\nReference: From a collection of [LINE stickers](https://store.line.me/stickershop/product/1011571/en).\\n![](/img/wap/wap-3.4.4.jpg)\\n\\nThese guys have great personalities and good weird shapes. They\u2019re a little outside my comfort style zone so definitely felt like a stretch.\\n\\nReference: This art is done by Anna Owen (seen in the image) but it looks like they\u2019ve removed their Tumblr and Twitter from existence so all that remains are Tumblr reblogs and Pinterest steals.

But I felt like this first one was a little too sketch-y to be my final piece for the week.\\n\\n![](/img/wap/wap-3.5.1.jpg)\\n\\nI decided to go for a more stylized one with proper line art and some sort of colour approach.\\n\\n![](/img/wap/wap-3.5.2.jpg)\\n\\nI found it weirdly difficult to make up my mind about soft colours and hard colours here. Ended up with the soft blend on the neck feathers and then the harder greys on the wings. I don\u2019t love the combo but I didn\u2019t like when the neck colours were hard edged. But otherwise, kind of pleased with this guy.\\n\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nNow that I\u2019ve done 3 weeks of animals I\u2019m going to try working on some smaller focus things for a few weeks.\\n\\nTime for a real artist challenge: Hands. Not sure how this one will go. But hoping to gain some hand confidence.\\n\\nMy pigeon Pinterest board with all my reference images [can be found here](https://www.pinterest.ca/maeanu3639/pigeons/)."},{"id":"wap-2","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/wap-2","source":"@site/blog/2024-01-13-week2-wap.md","title":"Weekly Art Practice - Week 2","description":"Week 2 is pangolins","date":"2024-01-13T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"January 13, 2024","tags":[{"label":"art","permalink":"/blog/tags/art"}],"readingTime":3.285,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Kylie","title":"Admin","url":"https://github.com/kylies","imageURL":"https://github.com/kylies.png","key":"kylie"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Weekly Art Practice - Week 2","description":"Week 2 is pangolins","slug":"wap-2","enableComments":true,"authors":["kylie"],"tags":["art"],"image":"/img/wap/wap-2.3.3.jpg"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Weekly Art Practice - Week 3","permalink":"/blog/wap-3"},"nextItem":{"title":"Weekly Art Practice - Week 1","permalink":"/blog/wap-1"}},"content":"A wild week at work resulted in me spending most of my evenings trying not to think about it by drawing. So here are a bunch of sketches of pangolins.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## Day 1 - Drawing from imagination\\n\\nSince day 1 is drawing from imagination I didn\u2019t want to look at a single reference image before starting. This resulted in a funny mistake.\\n\\n![Messy pangolin sketches.](/img/wap/wap-2.1.jpg)\\n\\nI had a moment early on, of asking myself, do pangolins have ears that poke out? I didn\u2019t want to break the assignment by looking at a reference so I gave them little poky ears\u2026 which was wrong.\\n\\n## Day 2 - Figure sketching\\n\\nI was able to correct my mental image of pangolins on day 2. These quick sketches reinforced my thinking that these guys have a similar build to squirrels in a few ways. They have the same triangle-ish arms, smaller chest zone big butt zone, long tails. But even with those similarities I feel like they give off very different vibes.\\n\\n![Quick pangolin sketches using references](/img/wap/wap-2.2.jpg)\\n\\n## Day 3 - Reference studies\\n\\nI really like day 3. Having an image up and scrutinising it for the mistakes I made in the first 2 days feels like the learning coming together. However this is also when I get torn about being more detail oriented (draw all the armour scales) and skipping over that because it\u2019s not the most educational in these exercises but is fun.\\n\\n![Pangolin walking](/img/wap/wap-2.3.1.jpg)\\n\\n![Pangolin making lovey eyes at the camera.](/img/wap/wap-2.3.2.jpg)\\n\\n![Pangolin trying to be a ball.](/img/wap/wap-2.3.3.jpg)\\n\\n![Close up artsy shot of a pangolin.](/img/wap/wap-2.3.4.jpg)\\n\\n\\n## Day 4 - Style studies\\n\\nHaving seen a few stylizing pangolins in the wild previously I knew I could get some good variety here. I tried to choose some of the more stylized versions to learn from. Especially when it comes to different approaches to doing the scales.\\n\\n![Vector art simplified pangolins.](/img/wap/wap-2.4.1.jpg)\\n\\nThese guys got simplified down to zig zag patterns which is pretty good. Though I don\u2019t love how it makes them look so smooth.\\n\\nReference: [VectorStock](https://www.vectorstock.com/royalty-free-vector/cute-pangolin-animal-in-various-poses-set-rare-vector-25524101)\\n\\n![Pattern based pangolins](/img/wap/wap-2.4.2.jpg)\\n\\nThese guys have just the hint of triangles to convey where the scales would be.

This time the struggle was pangolin poses. While I felt like I had spent the week getting their shape down I didn\u2019t really spend enough time watching them move about. Squirrels I see every day, I get them. Pangolins are pretty mysteries. So I felt a little limited by my ability to imagine them in a variety of poses.\\n\\n![Four digital pangolin sketches.](/img/wap/wap-2.5.jpg)\\n\\nI do at least like them, I think these pieces are still cute and do look like pangolins. But the movement and idea of looking at videos alongside still images is a good takeaway for creatures moving forward.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nWeek 2 felt like it went pretty smoothly. And that\u2019s with the hiccup of sending our iPad in for repairs. So this week\'s digital sketches were done on my Huion tablet that I set up for the first time in 3 years. This meant a little bit of adjustment time and tech troubleshooting before I could get to my daily practice. Slowed me down a bit but should now be prepared to survive without the iPad for a week.\\n\\nNow to prep for week 3: Pigeons\\n\\nMy pangolin Pinterest board with all my reference images [can be found here](https://www.pinterest.ca/maeanu3639/wap-2-pangolin/)."},{"id":"wap-1","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/wap-1","source":"@site/blog/2024-01-04-week1-wap.md","title":"Weekly Art Practice - Week 1","description":"First week of my new art practice schedule","date":"2024-01-04T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"January 4, 2024","tags":[{"label":"art","permalink":"/blog/tags/art"}],"readingTime":5.48,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Kylie","title":"Admin","url":"https://github.com/kylies","imageURL":"https://github.com/kylies.png","key":"kylie"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Weekly Art Practice - Week 1","description":"First week of my new art practice schedule","slug":"wap-1","enableComments":true,"authors":["kylie"],"tags":["art"],"image":"/img/wap/wap-1.3.1.jpg"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Weekly Art Practice - Week 2","permalink":"/blog/wap-2"},"nextItem":{"title":"Video Games - 2023 review","permalink":"/blog/games-2023"}},"content":"The way I titled this post implies that I\u2019ll post one of these every week\u2026 I don\u2019t think that\u2019s feasible. I have most of the first week of January off so this week is already easier than every week which will follow this year. I think it\u2019s more likely that I\u2019ll try to summarise one or two weeks a month, or I\u2019ll summarise a whole month of practice all at once. It will be difficult to find 15-30 minutes for art every day along with writing and blog management time.\\n\\nBut since I have the time now, I\u2019ll detail how this first week of the Jacob Drawfee Schedule went for me.\\n\\nTheme for week 1: Squirrels.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## Day 1 - Drawing from imagination\\n\\nSquirrels have been one of my obsessions since moving into my most recent apartment. We have a large back patio with an active squirrel highway (telephone line) that provides a lot of entertainment. I have collected a lot of photographs of squirrels hanging out and in the summer we put out water to help them stay hydrated so they come by more often.\\n\\n![Photograph of a squirrel visiting our water dish.](/img/patio-squirrel.jpg)\\n\\nI\u2019ve been trying to draw squirrels for the last year but even with their small form I feel like there is always something lacking from my sketches. They felt like the perfect first theme, giving me a chance to finally troubleshoot what about the squirrel makes them difficult for me to draw. On Sunday I filled a page in my sketchbook with different squirrel attempts while sketching for 15 minutes.\\n\\n![Photo of my sketch book filled with sketchy squirrels.](/img/wap/wap-1.1.jpg)\\n\\n## Day 2 - Speed sketching\\n\\nI prepared for day 2 in advance by preparing a [Pinterest board](https://www.pinterest.ca/maeanu3639/squirrel-refs/) of squirrel photographs as day 2 is basically quick figure drawing. Using references but mostly to grasp shapes and movement of the subject. It did take some time to collect images so I suspect this will be something I\u2019m trying to rush through before every new week starts.\\n\\nI set my timer to 15 minutes again. I probably spent too much time on the first page squirrels, somewhere in the 2-4 minute zone on each. This didn\u2019t feel like enough so I did a 2nd page where I forced myself to move through them a little faster.\\n\\n![Photo of a sketchbook page.](/img/wap/wap-1.2.1.jpg)\\n\\n![Photo of a sketchbook page covered in small squirrels](/img/wap/wap-1.2.2.png)\\n\\nThese felt pretty messy but it was interesting to see these squirrels next to my day 1 non-reference squirrels and see how much of a difference that makes already.\\n\\n## Day 3 - Reference Drawing\\n\\nI switched to the iPad for day 3 because I knew I\u2019d want the ability to draw over reference images. I find this extremely helpful when trying to really get the anatomy and proper shape down from a reference. I chose 4 photos to start with and didn\u2019t give myself a time limit. The goal for the day was 15 minutes but I think I spent closer to 20 minutes on each one.\\n\\n![Squirrel study 1](/img/wap/wap-1.3.1.jpg)\\n\\n![Squirrel study 2](/img/wap/wap-1.3.2.jpg)\\n\\n![Squirrel study 3](/img/wap/wap-1.3.3.jpg)\\n\\n![Squirrel study 4](/img/wap/wap-1.3.4.jpg)\\n\\nI was honestly very happy with the first study. I felt like I got the shapes right and captured a good squirrel face. 3 and 4 were tougher. In 3 I struggled to get the head right and 4 was so different from the other that I could barely get the proportion right. Hence breaking the image into sections and trying to figure it out from there. Overall I think I spent 2 hours from gathering the images to finalising the last one.\\n\\n## Day 4 - Style study\\n\\nI was really excited for day 4 which is for study from other artists. This is to help identify how other artists simplify the harder parts of the subject and which parts they focus on. I know that this is one of my main weaknesses, I often feel trapped between trying to stick to the details of realism or going so simple I love the main features of a creature. Conveniently I already had a [Pinterest board of squirrel art from last year](https://www.pinterest.ca/maeanu3639/squirrel-inspo/). Downside, there isn\u2019t as much cartoon squirrel art as I would like.\\n\\nI chose a few and started to approach them in the same way I did the reference photos. Try to figure out the central shapes, especially the ones that persisted between different artists. The small very simplified squirrels probably ended up being the most helpful as they often came in large groups.\\n\\n![Page one of style practice](/img/wap/wap-1.4.1.jpg)\\n\\n![Page two of style practice](/img/wap/wap-1.4.2.jpg)\\n\\nAfter sketching the reference images, I went and grabbed some more photos and then tried to draw the new photo while using the styles I was copying. This felt like a good stretch to try to apply the style I had been working from to something new instead of just trying to mimic the same image.\\n\\n## Day 5 - Drawing from imagination, take 2\\n\\nDay 5 was scary for me, felt like a test day. This day is meant to be an application of what you\u2019d learned from the past 3 days of drawing from references. I was scared that it would feel like day 1 and that I would be uncomfortable putting pencil to paper without a reference to look at.\\n\\nIn hopes of not getting afraid of the blank page I wrote down a few actions that a squirrel could be doing, jump, sleep, climb, run, sit. I looked back and my past few days of pages and then started drawing.\\n\\n![Day 5 sketches](/img/wap/wap-1.5.jpg)\\n\\nI was honestly rather surprised with the results. I felt like I finally had a good grasp of squirrel faces and proportions, even managed to try out multiple poses without references. Sure none of them were super dynamic but we\u2019re trying one thing pre week. I\u2019m mostly shocked at how much difference 3 days made:\\n\\n![side by side of day 1 and day 5](/img/wap/wap-1-comparison.jpg)\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nI feel like this first week is proof that this is a viable practice approach! I am still afraid of being able to commit to it every week for a year. And lowering how much time I can spend on each day will probably make progress slower (I\u2019m aiming for 15-30 minutes every day instead of the 1-2 hours I did this week). But now that I\u2019m familiar with what\u2019s needed each day I feel like that direction will be enough to carry me through most days.\\n\\nNow to prepare for week 2: Pangolins."},{"id":"games-2023","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/games-2023","source":"@site/blog/2024-01-01-games-2023.md","title":"Video Games - 2023 review","description":"Speed reviews of the games I played in 2023.","date":"2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"January 1, 2024","tags":[{"label":"games","permalink":"/blog/tags/games"}],"readingTime":9.48,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Kylie","title":"Admin","url":"https://github.com/kylies","imageURL":"https://github.com/kylies.png","key":"kylie"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Video Games - 2023 review","description":"Speed reviews of the games I played in 2023.","slug":"games-2023","enableComments":true,"authors":["kylie"],"tags":["games"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Weekly Art Practice - Week 1","permalink":"/blog/wap-1"},"nextItem":{"title":"Microjournaling aka hobby management","permalink":"/blog/microjournaling"}},"content":"I have re-written this blog post 3 times.\\n\\nI thought it would be easy, thought I could laugh in the face of game journalism. But instead I\u2019ve spent the last 2 weeks being rather critical of game journalism and thinking about how it can even be possible to review games if you don\u2019t finish them or physically have the time to play them to the end.\\n\\nI would be a hypocrite to give a review for games I didn\u2019t finish but also not finishing a game is generally a sign that I wasn\u2019t really feeling it, which is a review in and of itself.\\n\\nSo I think the best way to approach this isn\u2019t to say these are my reviews of games, but these are some games I loved and some I didn\u2019t love so much in 2023 and that\u2019s just one person\'s experience with them.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## The good\\n\\nThis was a banger year for AAA game releases this year. Some long awaited games dropped and they even managed to live up to expectations.\\n\\nThe first AAA game of the year I completed was a hold over. I didn\u2019t get far in **Elden Ring** in 2022 when we bought it, but something in early 2023 brought us back to it and completely hooked us. The early game that didn\u2019t click with me started to make sense, I finally got a grasp on the controls and small bits of the lore felt like the best reward you could find. It also helped that I felt like I started to get really good at it and would spend a lot of my time helping other people kill bosses in their worlds.\\n\\nMy time with **Tears of the Kingdom** was greatly enjoyed, but I still haven\u2019t reached the end. The world is sprawling and there\u2019s a new quest waiting for you under every rock. It was cool to get a voice acted Zelda and the powers you\u2019re gifted at the start of the game were a lot of fun, maybe even revolutionary for games going forward. It genuinely felt like a fresh way to engage with an open world. But I\u2019ll be honest, I didn\u2019t go about the world crafting masterpieces out of tree logs. I\u2019m pretty sure I under-used the crafting feature compared to other people. So while I had many moments of delight and I\u2019m sure what was done here is going to influence game development for the next 5 years, it wasn\u2019t my top game of the year.\\n\\nFire **Emblem Engage** had its moments but it didn\u2019t click for me. I didn\u2019t care for the main characters but I did love some of the side characters and there were some honest moments in the writing that got me to laugh out loud. But it became another game where I didn\u2019t make it to the credits.\\n\\n**Diablo 4** \u2013 I had never played a Diablo game before but my girlfriend has a fondness for them and the promise of couch co-op is all it takes to get me to be excited about a game. This game has some of the goriest cutscenes I\u2019ve ever seen and the story is very dark. But the game play is a nice level of mindless and constant which makes it a great game for melting the hours away while feeling powerful.\\n\\n**Baldur\u2019s Gate 3** was mind blowing for the first 50 hours or so, and then started to close up for me. I loved act 1 and 2 but then act 3 arrived and things began to feel too directed. Which makes sense, the plot lines do need to start wrapping up. But having started 3 new runs of the game in the first few weeks out of excitement, when I did have the credits roll for the first time, I honestly had no feelings of wanting to continue my other playthrough. Everything kind of fell flat.\\n\\nThere is a new epilogue that adds a lot more dialogue between characters at the end which people are hoping improves the ending but I\u2019m not sure when I\u2019ll have time to drop another 70 hours on playing BG3 again just to experience it.\\n\\nThe last AAA game of the year I played was **Mario Wonder**. I\u2019ve loved most Mario platformers and this one has a few new developments which keep things fresh. This is possibly the easiest platformer that\u2019s come out in a while? There are some very difficult levels that are mostly optional and very fun and stressful. But most of the regular levels never took more than one attempt when playing with two people.\\n\\nNow onto some indie darlings.\\n\\nTeenage dinosaurs facing the end of the world. [Goodbye Volcano High](https://goodbyevolcanohigh.com/) is one of the most ambitious musical VNs I\u2019ve ever experienced. ~~I think I have about 1 hour left and I\u2019m dragging my feet on it because I know the end will make me sad.~~ (Finished this hours before midnight on New Years Eve!) It has a lot of interesting stuff going on mechanic wise, small little interactions that keep you physically invested in controlling the character in small ways. The music was the big selling point for me though, I\u2019ve been listening to the [the original sound track](https://dabuaudio.bandcamp.com/album/goodbye-volcano-high-original-game-soundtrack) on repeat for weeks.\\n\\n[NUTS!](https://nuts.game/) I\u2019m not exclaiming this loudly, the title is all in the cap. But the exclamation point was added by me! This game was a gem to find. A natural surveillance game where you set up cameras in a forest to watch squirrels run around in the night. A game targeted specifically at me! I found this game rather scary (you are alone in the woods and this is a big fear of mine in the real world). It\u2019s really not scary but has some minor suspense floating about. This game is available on so many systems now, please play this game so people make more squirrel games.\\n\\nNext up, a game about fate, tarot cards, witches living in space: [The Cosmic Wheel Sisterhood](https://www.cosmicwheelsisterhood.com/). I loved the art for this as soon as I saw it, and the game idea instantly hooked me. I finished this and instantly started playing it again. One of the most unique games I\u2019ve played in a long time.\\n\\nA game I played for the first time this year that\u2019s been on the top of a lot of peoples charts was [Slay the Spire](https://www.gog.com/en/game/slay_the_spire). This was a lot of fun and it\u2019s cool to see the game that likely launched the wave of card based combat that is so prevalent right now. I got through the flow only once and I can see there is much more to the game that I would enjoy but there are too many games to keep playing this one over and over.\\n\\nThe game I had hesitated to play after hearing about it for months was **Vampire Survivors**. And the only reason I gave it a shot was because I had a 3 hour flight to fill and it can be played for free in offline mode on a phone. This game absolutely slaps and is a classic version of \u201cmore than meets the eye\u201d. Just a little weird game that took off overnight, can be bought for 3$ and is super addictive.\\n\\nAnd now for the only AAAA on the list (and likely in existence): **Genshin Impact**. I come and go with Genshin but I\u2019ve played for nearly 3 years straight at this point. While its basic gameplay mechanics aren\u2019t super impressive and I don\u2019t recommend this game to most people due to it being a gatha game, it does keep me coming back. There is something very captivating about watching the evolution of this game, its place in the world, the huge projects Hoyoverse undertakes, and the ridiculous crossovers. I can\u2019t look away from it.\\n\\n## The meh\\n\\n**Dredge** was an early release for the year and one I had on my rader from its demo release in 2022.I was pretty hype for this one, it does a lot of things I love: Weird occult magic in a small isolated town with a bunch of scary underwater creatures. Unfortunately the game fell flat in a lot of areas for me, there were things in the demo I was hoping to see more of but some of those parts of the game didn\u2019t feature as much in the full game (ferrying questionable stuff, struggle to stay alive, development of NPC stories). There have been some expansion since I finished it so I am a little curious to see if the new content would change my opinion but I don\u2019t have the urge to return to it just yet.\\n\\nThe first game I finished for the year was **Spirifarer**, a very beloved indie game that I enjoyed the first 10 hours of but then fell into a repetitive slump. I didn\u2019t love the main story arc and rushed the ending just to get things over with.\\n\\n**Hi-Fi Rush** was a surprise drop. I loved the art style and the fact that it was a rhythm combat game. The story was even decently fun with some good over the top characters. But I fell off of it after about 5-10 hours. There ended up being a bunch of powerup management and that\u2019s something that often turns me off games pretty quickly. Basic concept = lots of fun, developed concept = too much for me.\\n\\n## Analogue Pocket\\n\\nThis post has already gotten too long and I haven\u2019t even managed to mention all the GameBoy games I\u2019ve been playing on our new [Analogue Pocket](https://www.analogue.co/pocket). So I\u2019ll just say GameBoy games are still great, almost shockingly so. My current obsession is playing the French version of Pokemon Fire Red, a game I think I\u2019ve played 3 times in my life already. And I\u2019m now eyeing up games easily over 10 years old for the start of the new year.\\n\\n\\n## Kylie\u2019s State of the Game\\n\\nWhile most games I played ended up in my \u201cgood\u201d category for the year, it\u2019s a little strange to say that there wasn\u2019t a game that surpassed my current top three. (I\u2019m counting Elden Ring as a last year game as that\u2019s when it came out and I finished it before almost all the other games I played this year so it feels like forever ago, I honestly thought it was a year ago).\\n\\nElden Ring \u2013 Hades \u2013 Inscryption\\n\\nEverything I play is compared to those games right now. If I see even just a screencap of those games I want to go and play them again. NUTS came close but it was a pretty small indie project that we won\u2019t see much more of. Baldur\u2019s Gate 3 is technically impressive with it\u2019s huge branching choice system but stumbled at the end and having experienced many bugs in my playthrough (a major one even ruined a dramatic boss fight and story beat) it just can\u2019t stand up to my current top three.\\n\\nWith all these big games dropping this year I\u2019m not sure what to expect for 2024. I\u2019m sure there will be some more stealth drops that will catch the gaming world off guard, but I don\u2019t have anything that I\u2019m waiting for beyond the Elden Ring expansion. So maybe I\u2019ll have time to catch up on some older backlogs for once."},{"id":"microjournaling","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/microjournaling","source":"@site/blog/2023-12-27-microjournaling.md","title":"Microjournaling aka hobby management","description":"How I managed a year of hobbies.","date":"2023-12-27T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"December 27, 2023","tags":[],"readingTime":7.25,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Kylie","title":"Admin","url":"https://github.com/kylies","imageURL":"https://github.com/kylies.png","key":"kylie"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Microjournaling aka hobby management","description":"How I managed a year of hobbies.","slug":"microjournaling","enableComments":true,"authors":["kylie"],"tags":[],"image":"/static/img/micro-journal2.jpg"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Video Games - 2023 review","permalink":"/blog/games-2023"},"nextItem":{"title":"Books - 2023 review","permalink":"/blog/books-2023"}},"content":"This end of year post is rather different from the reviews I\u2019ve been writing. It\u2019s more of a personal review of a journaling method I\u2019ve been using this year to help manage multiple hobbies. If you are extremely minimalist while also loving to plan your life month by month, it could work for you too. But at the moment it\u2019s extremely tailored to me of my kind-of hyper organised lifestyle.\\n\\nThis approach came about after multiple chats with my therapist of me complaining about how I have no time for hobbies and when I commit to one it feels like I lose the ability to stay interested in the rest. I often hyper focus on whatever activity currently has me in its grips. The other focus of this method was to help balance executive dysfunction when it comes to those \u201cI would rather die\u201d tasks. Things like phoning the doctor, filing medical papers, or chores that have been put off for months.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n## Origin\\n\\nEven while being someone who loves to make a to-do list, I haven\u2019t been a journaler since my early teens. Unless we still count LiveJournal, then my early 20s. Once I was done with school the habit died off even more.\\n\\nThe bullet journal fad came and went (still here?) and while I was enamoured with the accessories, washi tape, nice journals, nice pens. It wasn\u2019t enough to get me to commit to keeping a journal.\\n\\nBut then I started therapy and I started to have more things to write down. I loved when my therapist would give me homework or a suggestion on an activity or emotion to chart. I liked being able to look back on progress while reminding myself that therapy was changing aspects of my life.\\n\\nThis never became anything huge but it meant I finally used some pages in my nice notebooks.\\n\\nAnd then there was the pandemic. I was already unemployed when the lockdown part of the pandemic hit Montreal, and like many people I fell into a bit of a malaise. My regular hobbies couldn\u2019t hold my attention, the world was falling apart and I spent hours doom scrolling. This became another thing to come up in therapy and the main suggestion I got was \u201ceven if you don\u2019t feel like doing X will be relaxing, try doing X for 10 minutes\u201d. The idea behind it was to give a hobby an honest try for a very small time commitment. If it wasn\u2019t working I could move on to something else pretty quickly. But if it felt good then I was likely to stick with it for much longer (This is very familiar to how you approach building a regular practice!).\\n\\nWith that advice I made it through the major lockdown and a major life change, touching my hobbies from time to time but mostly letting them fall to the side. At the end of 2022 I felt like things had settled enough that I could give my hobbies another try. But I was ambitious, I didn\u2019t want to get back into one hobby, I wanted to get back to most of them: drawing, reading, website development, and video games.\\n\\n(Video games were the most sturdy hobby, that one never really fell off. The problem with it was that it has the most potential to over take my time and push the other hobbies out.)\\n\\nAnd so with my previous experiences of to-do lists and methods of approaching hobbies, I made myself a single page journal.\\n\\n![Photo of my journaling process. One page is creative goal for the month while the 2nd page is a list of tasks for each month.](/img/micro-journal1.jpg)\\n\\n## The page\\n\\nSingle page maybe isn\u2019t accurate. I used a single page to plan my hobbies over the course of the year, and one more page for dealing with responsibilities.\\n\\nWhen I look at this I feel like I\u2019ve taken bullet journaling to the next level. An approach that was already pretty minimal and now I reduced it even further.\\n\\nFor each month I would prioritise a little bit of each hobby: 1 book, 1 video game, 1 art course, 1 blog post, 1 website project, etc.\\n\\n![Photo of my journaling process. The first page with my hobby goals on it.](/img/micro-journal2.jpg)\\n\\nMy idea behind this was that if I finished my game of the month, I would have to check off the other hobbies before returning to another new video game. This helped me to balance my free time between hobbies instead of just going to the easiest choice with my free time.\\n\\nThe one I do feel like I struggled with was reading. This is a hobby that can suck me in or turn me away. If I read a book I enjoy I\u2019ll start another one quickly and then can often get a streak going. But if I read something less exciting it\u2019s hard to get me to pick up a book for a few months. It was also a challenge because I was trying not to buy every book. I wanted to rely more on the library system. But this made it almost impossible to stick with my pre-planned reading list because most were new releases and the waiting list at the library for those could be months long.\\n\\nNote for myself to take into next year: Just buy a book if I feel like reading it (if I\u2019m still employed anyway). I buy most books digitally these days so it\u2019s not like I need to worry about them taking up space.\\n\\nOverall I loved this page. I loved checking things off, I loved being able to look at it to help me choose what hobby to work on, removing the indecisions of what exactly that hobby would be. If I wanted to read in August I\u2019d check this page and I would prioritise reading what I had chosen way back in January.\\n\\n## Tasks\\n\\nOn the page next to this one I broke it down by months once again. But this time with a to-do list for every month. This one wasn\u2019t filled out at the start of the year like the previous page. It was filled up as responsibilities would arise.\\n\\nThe main goal of this page was to 1 - keep myself focused on the more immediate responsibilities and 2 - stop me from feeling overwhelmed by responsibility.\\n\\nIt\u2019s easy to make a big list for trying to stay on top of everything in life, but that list could potentially be endless. So these lists had to be the things I didn\u2019t want to do but really needed to. Also I tried to limit every month to 5 things. You can do 5 things in a month.\\n\\nSometimes this helped to get those big things done early in the month. A quick checkoff to feel good about myself and then coast on free time for the rest. Some of the items you can see really dragged. Getting carried over to multiple months because I never got around to it (the list isn\u2019t magical, lol).\\n\\nThere is still one major outstanding task I didn\u2019t complete: buying renters insurance. It\u2019s something I really should do but it has multiple steps and involves phoning a company. A herculean task. But I keep copying it over, it keeps being one of my 5 things. Someday it will get done.\\n\\nReally this to-do list approach was about being kind to myself. While it was an act to focus on what I needed to get done, it helped me to know when I could turn off the guilt of not being responsible and just enjoy my time. And by limiting how many goals I would have for a month it rarely meant I had a month that would feel overwhelming.\\n\\n## And that\u2019s microjournaling\\n\\nI\u2019m calling this microjournaling as it\u2019s the smallest form of journaling I\u2019ve tried. Smaller than a bullet?? It takes up one open page of a notebook and nothing else. It takes minimal effort to put together and works more as a reference or guide for making choices. I\u2019m honestly super excited to fill out my page for next year. The only one I can usually fill in at the start is books because I have a huge backlog. For video games I check release dates and plan around those. The rest often get filled in as I find things I want to work on.\\n\\nBut a lot is still up to chance and where my interest takes me. It probably looks super rigid when shown like this, but I still felt like I had freedom to pursue my interests while feeling focused."},{"id":"books-2023","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/books-2023","source":"@site/blog/2023-12-18-books-2023.md","title":"Books - 2023 review","description":"Favourite books of 2023","date":"2023-12-18T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"December 18, 2023","tags":[{"label":"books","permalink":"/blog/tags/books"}],"readingTime":5.29,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Kylie","title":"Admin","url":"https://github.com/kylies","imageURL":"https://github.com/kylies.png","key":"kylie"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Books - 2023 review","description":"Favourite books of 2023","slug":"books-2023","enableComments":true,"authors":["kylie"],"tags":["books"],"image":"/static/img/2023-topbooks.jpg"},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Microjournaling aka hobby management","permalink":"/blog/microjournaling"},"nextItem":{"title":"21 Draw - A year in review","permalink":"/blog/21draw-review"}},"content":"I used to set myself much loftier goals for books read during the year. But I also used to buy many more physical books. These days I\u2019ve prioritised reading on a Kobo due to ease and space. I\u2019ve moved 7 times in the last 12 years, books make up for a lot of weight. I\u2019ve even started to take my books to one of those free micro libraries. Boxes on the side of the street where you can take or leave books. At least the ones I don\u2019t see myself ever re-reading. It\u2019s helped free up space for\u2026 newer books.\\n\\n![Cover images of Iron Widow, Some Desperate Glory, and The Mountain in the Sea](/img/2023-topbooks.jpg)\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## The challenge\\n\\nGoodReads always wants you to give yourself a challenge to read, to state how many books you\u2019ll read in the following year. Knowing my reading habit was on the decline I haven\u2019t been setting this very high. I just had 12 this year (and I\u2019m still one short but suspect I\u2019ll read 1 or 2 over winter break).\\n\\nThis year I really wanted to read the recent faves. Books that were making the lists of most anticipated or best of the year. After years of playing catchup I wanted to see if I could keep up with recent releases.\\n\\nThe answer is no, I couldn\u2019t keep up. But also, since Twitter is dying and that\u2019s where I get a lot of my book news and commentary, reading the hits of 2023 didn\u2019t get me much extra engagement. I would have loved to hear other people\u2019s thoughts on these books as they came out but when you spend less time on social media you end up less social. Go figure.\\n\\nI don\u2019t want to review all the books I read, I put small reviews up on [StoryGraph](https://app.thestorygraph.com/profile/lautir) (the non-Amazon version of GoodRead) and also [GoodReads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2315520-kylie). Here I\u2019m just going to go over my top 3 for the year.\\n\\n## [Some Desperate Glory by Emily Tesh](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/c6402cfc-fff1-4b40-a30b-7ebe32871b68)\\n\\nThis book has been hitting many of the top sci-fi charts for the year. SDG starts out with your pretty typical sci-fi setup. A group of rebel humans fight and prepare for war against an alien race that destroyed their planet. Their sworn revenge keeps them going with small numbers and ageing technology.\\n\\nIt has strong Battlestar Galactica vibes. Military space opera. Not every kid in training gets to join the combat ranks, they are competing for placements. Some are confined to being breeding stock so that the resistance can keep their population alive.\\n\\nThe main character has extremely traditional views (very strong gender rules are enforced, most people on the station are white, and everyone who isn\u2019t human is bad). Her world is turned upside down after an alien is captured and held prisoner, followed by her brother going AWOL. Setting off the chain of events of Kyr (our protagonist) having her eyes opened to the galaxy and what exists beyond her limited space station.\\n\\nAbout a third of the way in, the book does a pretty big twist. So if the opening feels a little too basic (it kind of did for me), hold out till then.\\n\\n## [Iron Widow by Xiran Jay Zhao](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/8f403954-2950-4903-bdc3-cecb460279e2)\\n\\nIt\u2019s hard to beat the opening description line of Iron Widow on StoryGraph.\\n\\n> \u201cPacific Rim meets The Handmaid\u2019s Tale in this blend of Chinese history and mecha science fiction for YA readers.\u201d\\n\\nIron Widow goes hard. A leading character who wants more for herself. A better life, a better system of life. Giant robots powered by sucking the life out of a pair of drivers, tasked with defending civilization from a mysterious powerful threat.\\n\\nWe got death, violence, forced addiction, abuse of all sorts. Quickly followed by a love triangle, political manoeuvring and big plays for power. Everything plays out between gruesome fights and beautiful facades of the lives of pilots. Nowhere feels safe during the story. Even the ending doesn\u2019t let you relax. So it\u2019s a good thing that book 2 is on the way.\\n\\n\\n## [The Mountain in the Sea by Ray Nayler](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/ae637112-1291-493a-bc06-c1d313ae7d83)\\n\\nThis book caught my attention with this blurb before it was released.\\n\\n> \u201cRumors begin to spread of a species of hyperintelligent, dangerous octopus that may have developed its own language and culture. Marine biologist Dr. Ha Nguyen, who has spent her life researching cephalopod intelligence, will do anything for the chance to study them.\u201d\\n\\nIf attending squid classes this year, my underwater themed D&D campaign, and my collection of aquatic art hasn\u2019t given it away, I\u2019m in my cephalopod era. Which is how this and a few other ocean themed books ended up on my reading list. In my initial review I included this list of similar media:\\n\\nYou will like this if you enjoyed things like:\\n- The Arrival\\n- Work by Becky Chambers\\n- The world building of Malka Older\\n\\nThe major themes of Mountain are language (Arrival) and \u2018what is consciousness\u2019 (I feel like Becky Chambers touched on this a bit though there are many others who do as well.). But the reason I included Becky Chambers here is that Ray has a strong human element in their sci-fi like Chambers does. A lot of time is spent thinking about how people exist with new technology and how it shapes life.\\n\\nIn Ray\u2019s story, we are seeing 3 different types of life intersect. The humans, the very first near human passing android, and a group of octopuses. I\u2019ve always had a love for androids living with or as humans in stories, this novel places androids right at the start of that journey. No one else is really writing about the development of octopus societies but that could change in the next few decades as we continue to learn more about them (fingers crossed).\\n\\n## Next year\\n\\nI don\u2019t have a strong focus for what to read next year yet. I have a few things I didn\u2019t get to this year which I definitely want to get to. With my second goal being to read some of the physical books I\u2019ve started to collect. But also maybe revisit some favourite writers from a few years ago who\u2019ve I\u2019ve ignored while trying to branch out and read the new folks rising up.

I had tried a few online learning programs over the years, more so when I was unemployed, but none with a year long commitment. I didn\u2019t have any big plans for the year, I was going in with a kind of consistent job, a life still lived under semi-lockdown, and a longing to return to hobbies I\u2019d struggled to get back into. I wasn\u2019t sure how this was going to go but I had hoped that putting some money down would help motivate me, setting myself a goal of doing 1 course per month.\\n\\nIn the end, I finished 20 of the 24 courses I started.\\n\\nThere\u2019s no way I could review all of them so I\u2019m going to highlight my favourites in case anyone else wants to give 21Draw a chance.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## What makes a good course\\n\\nThere are a few key points that make me view a course positively:\\n- Homework assignments feel worth my time and are present (I\u2019m not building my 10th moodboard)\\n- Lessons are short and have a take away (1 hour of watching someone paint isn\u2019t my jam)\\n- Something new is introduced\\n\\nI was a little surprised at how many of the courses didn\u2019t have any homework and how lots of the illustrations were just watchings someone else work. You can definitely learn a lot from watching someone else work but if they aren\u2019t well set up to show you the settings, brushes and techniques they are using, the take-aways are limited.\\n\\nI also grew tired of how many courses started with the bare minimum of \u201cthis is how you use procreate\u201d. It\u2019s good the first time around, or when an artist explains a more complex or less used feature. But I think 21Draw could benefit from a series of \u201cintro to software\u201d lesson where the basics are covered in a stand alone course and then each artist doesn\u2019t need to repeat the same info in the lessons.\\n\\n## Top 5 courses\\n\\n### [Storytelling with illustration](https://www.kymira.ca/blog/storytelling-illustrations/):\\nGreat at introducing ways to change the feel and story of the scene by using things like perspective, foreground background, and colour.\\n\\n### [How to Stylize Characters](https://www.kymira.ca/blog/stylized-characters/):  \\nI wasn\u2019t familiar with the process of starting from silhouettes before and this has very much changed my way of thinking about character and creature design. And now that I\u2019ve seen it here I\u2019m starting to see it everywhere from professional concept artists I watch. Just some really great, instantly applicable tricks to make your piece more interesting.\\n\\n### [Designing fun animal characters](https://wwww.kymira.ca/blog/bean-approach/):  \\nWhile this introduces a rather simple process for drawing cute characters, the base is really helpful for starting something new. Not only that, its limitations force you to become more creative with it.\\n\\n### [Landscapes](https://www.kymira.ca/blog/landscapes/):\\nI knew nothing about landscapes before this course and now it\u2019s become one of my most common art types of the year. I loved working in greyscale and the slow refinement process that\u2019s introduced really helps make landscapes less intimidating.\\n\\n### [Mastering lighting](https://kymira.ca/blog/learning-light/):  \\nI thought I had a pretty good grasp of light but this course taught me I knew nothing. Covers the terminology for different kinds of light and shadows while showing how to incorporate them into a piece. I had no idea what Mask layers were for before this.\\n\\n### [Intro to animation](https://kymira.ca/blog/2d-animation/):\\nAfter watching multiple intro to animation videos this year I feel like I can confidently say that this one does a good job of covering the main concepts of 2d animation. The assignments were good and I felt like I took away a lot of new knowledge from this one.\\n\\n![The 4 pieces from the light lesson](/img/21-draw-img/Lighting-studies.jpg)\\n\\n## Fav art pieces of the year\\n\\n![Collage of my fave art pieces for the year.](/img/artwork/2023-art-recap.jpg)\\n\\n## Final feelings on 21Draw\\n\\nI\u2019m extremely happy with my 21Draw purchase. There was certainly a variety of quality when it came to the courses. It felt like some had more support than others when being made. And if you take a lot of intro level courses you end up hearing the same intro level content on repeat. It\u2019s a gamble I was willing to take, with the decent sized catalogue of courses there was always something new to try if there was a course that wasn\u2019t working for me.\\n\\nI won\u2019t be renewing my subscription for a 2nd year as I think there\u2019s only 10 courses left that I haven\u2019t checked out. I\u2019m eyeing up the learning platform [Domestika](https://www.domestika.org/en) for my 2024 learning. I do plan to keep an eye on 21Draw releases over the next year, and if they get a few more interesting ones I could see signing up again in the future for the next content.\\n\\nHowever, one major thing has stood out while doing this year in review. I have much fewer completed pieces than I would like.\\n\\nThis is mostly my fault, I didn\u2019t do all the assigned homeworks and baulked at having to do 1 full illustration for a course instead of smaller pieces or homeworks. So while Domestika looks really fun, I\u2019m also considering doing a few months of focused practice instead of focused learning.\\n\\n21Draw was a great way to re-familiarize myself with the basics and also many of the steps of the process I never learned. But when a course is 7 hours long and it\u2019s mostly just watching someone else work, that 7 hours I don\u2019t spend drawing myself.\\n\\nI think for January I\u2019m going to try to follow a practice schedule, specifically the one Jacob Drawfee goes over in this Drawclass: Jacob\'s No Pressure Guide to Learning How to Enjoy Art Practice.\\n\\n<iframe width=\\"560\\" height=\\"315\\" src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/BeP3T511C-w?si=u-RLawqUyXpKyJga\\" title=\\"YouTube video player\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\\n\\nIt boils down to trying to draw 5 days out of the week, with a specific focus for the week and what to do each day. I\u2019d love to say I\u2019ll commit to a year of it but that feels rather intimidating at the moment. Especially with a few projects and volunteer programs in the works for 2024. So we\u2019ll see how far I can get. And if each week might make for a worthy blog post."},{"id":"catch-up","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/catch-up","source":"@site/blog/2023-11-19-catch-up.md","title":"November Wrap Up","description":"October ended up being one of my busiest months of the year, which led to only sporadic 21 Draw lessons between travelling and playing Baldur\u2019s Gate 3.","date":"2023-11-19T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"November 19, 2023","tags":[{"label":"art","permalink":"/blog/tags/art"},{"label":"21draw","permalink":"/blog/tags/21-draw"},{"label":"altar stone","permalink":"/blog/tags/altar-stone"}],"readingTime":5.67,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Kylie","title":"Admin","url":"https://github.com/kylies","imageURL":"https://github.com/kylies.png","key":"kylie"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"catch-up","enableComments":true,"title":"November Wrap Up","image":"/img/artwork/Fish-sheet.jpg","authors":["kylie"],"tags":["art","21draw","altar stone"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"21 Draw - A year in review","permalink":"/blog/21draw-review"},"nextItem":{"title":"Getting into animation","permalink":"/blog/2d-animation"}},"content":"October ended up being one of my busiest months of the year, which led to only sporadic 21 Draw lessons between travelling and playing Baldur\u2019s Gate 3.\\n\\nIn December I plan to do a few end of year posts which means I want to try to cover the last 2 months of art practice in this post.

But the more central part of the program, breaking animals down into basic shapes and ways to portray age and personality with some design choices were helpful.\\n\\nI ended up only working on the sketch phases with the references I had. I do love drawing animals but doing simplifications or cartoonification is definitely a weakness of mine. I struggle to choose what details aren\u2019t important and can be left out. And I struggle to make eyes larger for soften personalities instead of trying to replicate sizes to proper anatomical proportions.\\n\\n![Sketches of Albert and Leon](/img/21-draw-img/Pet-sketches.jpg)\\n\\n## 21 Draw - Colour Theory & Intermediate Procreate\\n\\nI started and nearly finished it (I\u2019ll probably wrap it up next week), a short course of colour theory. A few of the longer digital painting lessons touched on colour theory so a lot of this was repeat information to me but it had a few gems still. Colour theory is something I over think, or that there is some mystical secret behind. But I feel like it really comes down to understanding the colour wheel and having a good eye for colour. I\u2019ve been forcing myself to work with palettes a little more in my last few pieces as well as to use the Procreate colour selector to check complementary and tertiary colours for my main colour themes.\\n\\nThis had a few pieces of homework but none of them interested me so I didn\u2019t do them. I probably should have for the practice but I felt like I had multiple courses on the go at this point and was struggling to focus on putting Apple pencil to tablet.\\n\\nI\u2019m not super confident in my colour selection of pieces, I probably go way too saturated most of the time. And then jump around to whatever colour I like instead of taking the time to see if colours work well together.\\n\\n[Simone Gr\xfcnewald](https://www.instagram.com/schmoedraws/)\u2019s intermediate Procreate lesson has been pretty good but it\u2019s hard to focus on a 5 hour course with no homework assignments. The main thing this course did for me was convince me to buy [Max Ulichney\u2019s Watercolor Brushes for Procreate](https://maxpacks.com/). Simone used these for nearly her whole painting process and I really came around to how they looked and behaved during the main hours I watched her paint.\\n\\n## D&D Maps\\n\\nThese pieces were small projects during the year I didn\u2019t post about as they contain spoilers for the D&D campaign I\u2019m running. They\u2019re maps that are meant to convey locations of places easily to players instead of a battle map. I\u2019ll often find battle maps online for my needs but for more unique locations I want to be able to communicate the area I\u2019ve created and find that this can be more reliably done with images. Hence spending way too much time on these maps that the players may never fully see.\\n\\n![Exploration grid map of a sunken island city](/img/artwork/Ruins-map.jpg)\\n\\n![Layer map of a library carved into an underwater stalagmite.](/img/artwork/Library-outpost-five.jpg)\\n\\n## Altar Stone Projects\\n\\nIt\u2019s been a while since we launched a new song (see October being busy) but I\u2019ve been picking away at putting together scenes for future music.\\n\\nOne project started with a fish sheet.\\n\\n![A sheet of a variety of pink fish.](/img/artwork/Fish-sheet.jpg)\\n\\nI love seeing other artists\' sheets of creatures. There\u2019s often so much variety to each creature and everyone interprets them all a little differently. My fish sheet is all fictional creatures as I wanted to build up a repertoire of basic fish to have around in the D&D campaign. So I spent a lot of time looking at fish and then smashing together my favourite bits of real fish to make up these fake fish.\\n\\nThen I started to animate them.\\n\\nNot all of them, but so far I\u2019ve created simple animation loops for at least 6 of them. Then I made them a place to swim.\\n\\n![An underwater scene of rocks, sea weed, and a dome in the distance.](/img/artwork/Underwater-arch.jpg)\\n\\nI\u2019ve put together this full animated scene already but it\u2019s not online yet, so you\u2019ll have to wait to see the completed piece.\\n\\nNext up was a player request. I introduced a giant awoken octopus as a smith in my underwater city. People thought he was pretty cool and asked if he had a themed song (he did not). But my girlfriend went ahead and tried a few things to put together something that could capture a forge vibe.\\n\\nFor this piece I really wanted to try out the MaxU watercolour brushes I mentioned above. They seem well fitted for background work and I wanted something more gritty and textual than my previous background pieces. This did mean it took much longer as I had both a learning process to get through and many layers to work with to get the right blend of colours and textures from the brushes.\\n\\nI\u2019m not super satisfied with the final product, I know what areas I want to touch up, but I\u2019m leaving them for the animation edits so that I can play with lighting more dynamically instead of having it painted on directly. Hilariously enough, the large octopus going in front of this will cover most of the background anyway.\\n\\n![A scene of a large medieval looking furnace in a forge.](/img/artwork/Forge-bg.jpg)\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nI\'m hoping to squeeze in one more 21 Draw course between November and December. Then my subscription will come to an end. I\'m already making plans for 2024 and what I want to focus on but we\'ll see how well those plans hold up. After a year of trying out a lot of different stuff, I can see myself ending back up at figure drawing lessons once again."},{"id":"2d-animation","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2d-animation","source":"@site/blog/2023-09-24-animation.md","title":"Getting into animation","description":"A few months ago my girlfriend asked if I could draw a piece of art to be the image of a YouTube video for her music.

But this meant having a visual aspect to the music as well.\\n\\nAn idea came to mind pretty quickly for this and I was able to put it almost all tonight in an evening. A large octopus with a sword fight with silhouettes of the characters from the campaign:\\n\\n![A giant pink octopus holding a sword, facing off 5 silhouettes of adventurers.](/img/artwork/octo-fight1.jpg)\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\nBefore we got around to uploading the song, she got the idea to try animating a part of it so it wasn\u2019t just a static image for 1 hour. I cut out the sword as a separate layer, she put both pieces into PowerPoint and ta-da, we got a spinning sword:\\n\\n<iframe width=\\"560\\" height=\\"315\\" src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/mE8iykMUzuk?si=TsYqWsZYlsXYJqLc\\" title=\\"YouTube video player\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\\n\\nWith the publication of this first video, [Project Altar Stone](https://www.youtube.com/@altarstone) was launched, and so began my focus on 2D animation.\\n\\n## From PowerPoint to ToonSquid\\n\\nAs mentioned, my girlfriend animated the first video in PowerPoint and this worked surprisingly well. But PowerPoint has its limitations (you can only animate one thing at a time) and I already had ideas for how the next video could go. I have some video editing experience with a program called Camtasia so this is what I brought the next song project into.\\n\\nUnfortunately, Camtasia was rather limited on the animation front as it\u2019s more designed for traditional video editing (doing green screens, layovers, highlighting mouse movements). I was using it to make tutorial videos at a previous job. But since I had a paid version of this software I was hoping to make it work. After some Googling I learned that my version was a few updates behind and if I wanted to find tutorials or troubleshoot issues I would almost always be finding ones that reference the new version.\\n\\nAnd so the hunt for 2D animation software began.\\n\\nSince I do almost all my digital art on an iPad these days, that\u2019s where the search started. It\u2019s pretty easy to find a top 10 best animation apps list, but still hard to choose one when you don\u2019t really know what features of an app you want are. So I read some guides, watched some videos and eventually settled on a rather recent new program [ToonSquid](https://toonsquid.com/).\\n\\nToonSquid has a few short tutorials on YouTube, keywords I understood (keyframes, onions layers) and a rather impressive intro demo video. And possibly it\u2019s biggest selling point, it was a one time purchase instead of a subscription model! So with that research phase done, it was on to video number 2.\\n\\n\\n## Learning the tools of the trade\\n\\nWith ToonSquid came a lot of learning, watching tutorial videos, experimenting with tools, etc. Our second video came from both of us learning how to use ToonSquid. Definitely had some struggles so this process felt a little messy but resulted in us learning some best practices to take forward into the next one.\\n\\nEven with those learning hiccups, I\u2019m pretty happy with how the video came out with two major objects being animated at once. And it was a good challenge for me to learn to draw and design a fantasy submarine, something I felt pretty scared to do.\\n\\n<iframe width=\\"560\\" height=\\"315\\" src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/OYB_MDRmDq4?si=kDrBCzfaOKHnlj_0\\" title=\\"YouTube video player\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\\n\\nVideo three is rather simple from an animation perspective, but was a big challenge for me as I set myself the goal of drawing an alleyway for a world I didn\u2019t have a great visual grasp of. Did a lot of Pinterest searching for \u2018fantasy market\u2019 and \u2018fantasy alleyway\u2019 to get ideas. Then it was time to get familiar with the perspective tools Procreate has to offer. These ended up great for blocking in the basic shapes and helping to get the lines of the boxes and door at the right angle.\\n\\nOther things I learned in this one was how to make repeating pattern blocks, which is how I made the cobblestone road. This took some precise copy and pasting which I didn\u2019t love as it was easy to mess up the seam lines. But it was cool to learn the basic approach for making repeating patterns.\\n\\n<iframe width=\\"560\\" height=\\"315\\" src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/yRvnEvGGnhs?si=J2zNuo_ocYuT0nrI\\" title=\\"YouTube video player\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\\n\\n(There is a second version of this video with more animations but it\u2019s a secret until a specific D&D session.)\\n\\nVideo three is a return to combat which meant revisiting our very first scene. Coming at this with the knowledge learned from the first three videos made this more complex and also easier. I knew exactly what I needed to be separate layers which would give me lots of options to play with when moving over to ToonSquid. This did result in me hitting the Procreate layer limit for the first time ever, oops. My big mistake in this one is that I did too much shading on the tentacles which completely falls apart once things start moving. Still need to remind myself to not think of these images as static.\\n\\nThanks to all the layers, this is our most active video yet. 8 different tentacles moving at once, the octopus mantle moves a bit, and even got the octopus eyes moving about.\\n\\n<iframe width=\\"560\\" height=\\"315\\" src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/UY0mnrQdfAw?si=0lEylxCRnSRHch1A\\" title=\\"YouTube video player\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\\n\\n## Back to 21 Draw\\n\\nWhen I started going through the 21 Draw course offerings I hadn\u2019t really considered taking the intro to 2D animation one, but once this project started to take off I added it to my queue. It had a lot of the foundational stuff that was covered by the same teacher in his other courses and that I\u2019ve blogged about before. But he spent more time on the 12 Principles of Animation from Disney and ran through what seems like some of the classic beginner animation challenges.\\n\\nI enjoy the practice of starting off learning to animate with a flour sack. For the assignment he gave us making the sack jump:\\n\\n<img src={Sackjump} width=\\"400\\"/>\\n\\nThen we ran through a longer thumbnailing exercise of laying out the key frames of a longer animation. Rabbit character picks up a piece of paper and then ~something happens~ left up for the learner to decide:\\n\\n![rabbit image](/img/21-draw-img/rabbit-animation.jpg)\\n\\n## What\u2019s next\\n\\nWhile the idea of doing a large flip book project is very daunting, it\u2019s something that now feels doable. I was complaining previously about sometimes only having 20 minutes to get some drawing time in and while working on animations 20 minutes felt like a decent amount of time to get a frame or two done. Sure if I think about how little a single frame is seen it can make that kind of work feel less rewarding, but seeing a small animation play out has been a lot of fun.\\n\\nI\u2019m now in the brainstorming phase for future song animations while spending time on YouTube looking for more intro to 2D animation tutorials. Now trying to balance working on animation while still trying to do one or two 21 Draw courses every month."},{"id":"learning-light","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/learning-light","source":"@site/blog/2023-08-29-lighting.md","title":"Learning Light","description":"After getting through a large portion of the beginner level courses on 21 Draw, I finally felt like I could start dipping into the intermediate level courses.

Starting with [Aveline Stokart\u2019s](https://www.avelinestokart.com/) \u2018Mastering Lighting and Shading\u2019.\\n\\nThis is one of 21 Draws top highlighted courses, a large portion of it is even available for [free on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdMxg3lVGGI). Now that I\u2019ve completed the whole thing it definitely deserves the top slot on the website and I would highly recommend it for anyone who wants to get more creative with lighting in their illustrations.\\n\\nIt starts by walking you through the basics of light and shadows on simple shapes. I always forget the specific names for different types of light and shadows so this was good for me, even if I\u2019ve forgotten half of the names already. Then we did some studies of movie scenes to grasp light in action and after that Aveline provides a sketch that you then use to create 4 different lighting scenarios which is where the real takeaways come from.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## Learning to see light\\n\\nOne of the exercises that Aveline gives is to study movie shots. This has come up before in other courses for studying composition and colours, but her approach was all about understanding how light was being used in the scene. Be it to highlight something specific in the scene to draw the eye or set the tone.\\n\\nI chose this Black Swan shot for my study because I wanted something simple to get through the exercises quickly.\\n\\n![A screenshot from the movie Black Swan next to a digital painting copy.](/img/21-draw-img/black-swan-study.jpg)\\n\\nI don\u2019t like it when I look at it in full size as the colours are all off, but every time I see this in thumbnail form on the Procreate project selection screen it looks pretty good!\\n\\n## The base\\n\\nThe base sketch is a girl with a small dragon. We filled in the flats, gave it a simple background and filled in some details like the cookie box and her shirt.\\n\\n![Character in a park on a sunny day.](/img/21-draw-img/base-light-colors.jpg)\\n\\n## Scenario 1: Sunny day\\n\\nThe first lighting scenario was a bright sunny day with the light coming through between the tree branches. It was in this first explainer video that I learned how many layers it takes to do light well. I think Aveline used over 10 different layers to pull off this look. That\u2019s layers for bounce light, ambient light, specular light, general highlights, and on and on.\\n\\nI\u2019d never worked with Mask layers before so this was an interesting one to see right from the start. And makes a lot of sense given a lesson I picked up from a different course: Lighting is more about erasing than painting. You carve out the areas being hit by light. I\u2019ve done that in the past to create minor vignette effects but to see it used to create the main light regions in an illustration was something else!\\n\\n![Character in a park on a sunny day.](/img/21-draw-img/Sunny_Day.jpg)\\n\\n## Scenario 2: Night - Glow\\n\\nIn the second challenge the bright day is completely flipped for a dark night. The lighting layers are all deleted, we keep the base colours around, and start again.\\n\\nI generally find glows really fun to work with in digital art. There are lots of options to play with and room for experimentation. In this scene it\u2019s the little dragon giving off the glow so we have the direction of the light change from the first scene. The light is also more tinted then the light of the sun so the whole scene feels drastically shifted away from the vibrant day.\\n\\n![Character outside in the dark with a glowing dragon.](/img/21-draw-img/Magic_Night.jpg)\\n\\n## Scenario 3: Indoors - Overcast\\n\\nFor scenes 3 and 4 we\u2019ve moved inside. So quickly through a new background together; walls and some hanging art.\\n\\nSame approach, delete all the previous lighting layers, choose a new ambient base colour and start adding layers. I think I went a little too dark on this one, it\u2019s pretty easy to over shoot a colour and a good opacity level.\\n\\n![Character inside on an overcast day.](/img/21-draw-img/Overcast.jpg)\\n\\n## Scenario 4: Indoors - Sunset\\n\\nNow going to warm colours for a sunset vibe that\u2019s much more intense then the overcast day in the previous one. Both of these scenarios moved to a more backlit character and I may have lost details in the girl\'s face. One of the other important tips, which I still struggled to execute, is when it\u2019s okay to cheat.\\n\\nYou can live by the realistic movements of light and shadows but if you want to balance your piece and have the important parts pop, it\u2019s good to \u201ccheat\u201d by adding highlights to locations that need it to stand out. You still follow the rules of the scene, where the lights are coming from, colour, etc. But if it means putting a bit of highlight on a dark face to make a face more visible, it\u2019s usually the right call.\\n\\n![Character inside while the sun sets.](/img/21-draw-img/Sunset.jpg)\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nBefore this course I didn\u2019t think about light too much. I always have a mental map of where light is coming from when shading a character and thought was enough. And sure it was fine for rather flat character work, but going through all the steps to add even baseline lighting to these scenes has reinforced how much heavy lifting lighting does to create a scene and vibe. I feel less afraid to tackle a whole illustration now, and maybe take a few more daring approaches to lighting characters in the future.\\n\\n![All 4 light studies.](/img/21-draw-img/Lighting-studies.jpg)"},{"id":"landscapes","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/landscapes","source":"@site/blog/2023-08-12-landscapes.md","title":"Learning landscapes","description":"While this is one of the most popular courses on 21 Draw I didn\u2019t prioritise it.

My interests had always been more around character design and creatures. But after branching out in a few other courses, I thought it would be time to keep trying to step out of my comfort zone.\\n\\nThis course is taught by [Philip Sue](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCI2LeV6oDbGd8LJ8iUneSZA) and it looks like he has a lot of step by step process videos on his YouTube which likely cover a lot of the things covered in this course.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## Greyscales\\n\\nJust like in a lot of the other courses I\u2019ve taken so far, this one started out with silhouettes. It was a pretty free form first exercise, work with the 5 tones to compose a background, midground, and foreground. The assignment pushed you to make five different pieces which was a good stretch and quickly where I started to diverge a little too much from the guidelines.\\n\\n![Figuring out compositions with greyscale work](/img/21-draw-img/Landscape-thumbnails.jpg)\\n\\nMy first few landscapes felt reasonable, but then I started to get ideas for D&D game locations. These started off problematic as I was too \u201czoomed in\u201d to follow lots of the advice that was being provided for landscapes. They could probably work as general illustrations but there wasn\u2019t enough distance between the features to really follow the next steps. Which is what pushed me to continue with only 2 pieces instead of 3 like the course suggested.\\n\\n## Colours\\n\\nTHe courses provided some palettes to try out but I didn\u2019t want to screenshot the video and then pull the colours into Clip Studio so I looked up some other palettes on Pinterest. These weren\u2019t as curated so it was actually more time confusing and not super rewarding. The orange, desert-y one was from the instructor while my green ring ended up being mostly eye balled. But I was at least happy to have 2 very different colourscapes to work with.\\n\\n![Laying down base colours over the grey thumbnails](/img/21-draw-img/Landscapes-lighting-v1.jpg)\\n\\nThere was a step for experimenting with colours and lighting, and I would have loved to have access to Procreate\'s Gradient Maps for that, but in Clip I played around with colours layers and some manual re-painting. I had always thought I had a pretty good natural grasp of lighting but on trying to get more creative with it in these scenes I started to question that. Good thing there\u2019s a whole class on lighting that I can still take.\\n\\n## Detailing\\n\\nAfter composition and colours comes making the thumbnail huge and getting into the details.\\n\\nThe first one, my desert, thankfully doesn\u2019t have many details going on. Touched up the lighting, added some extra rocks and made a very simple stream. I probably spent just as much time looking for nice cloud brushes. It definitely took a while to get used to the movements of painting and erasing over and over again to try to create the right shapes in the mountains, and I still don\u2019t feel like I nailed that, but I feel like I\u2019m getting closer at least. I re-painted a few of them a few times, trying out different brushes and techniques. Most of them ended up smoothing things out too much and losing the rock-like texture of large sweeping strokes. Which feels like the largest challenge of painting like this, you kind of want to work minimally as more strokes or colours ends up washing out the sharp lines and features.\\n\\n![Final version of my desert](/img/21-draw-img/Desert-landscape.jpg)\\n\\nI\u2019m pretty happy with how this came out in the end. There are definitely areas I can see improvements for already, but it feels \u201cbig\u201d which is what I wanted to learn to do in this course.\\n\\nFor my green pieces I felt like I had fallen into my \u201ctoo zoomed in\u201d habit here a bit too. I ended up spending a lot of time on detailing the big stone ring, and adding plant textures with plant brushes. All the while I should have been working further out to a point of not seeing any of these details.\\n\\n![Final version of my forest ring](/img/21-draw-img/Ring-landscape.jpg)\\n\\nI also struggled with the colour balance a bit more here. I wanted the sun to be rising behind the mountains which made for minimal light hitting the side we could actually see. And some of the mountains felt like they started to disappear, which I guess makes sense if the light is so bright behind them, but I ended up darkening up a lot of features so that the lines between layers of distance still made sense.\\n\\n## Final review\\n\\nOverall I found this course had the perfect balance of lesson + homework. It had some great foundational takeaways and you could instantly apply what was being taught. I struggled a little bit with the program being Photoshop in the course, but nearly all the features also exist in Clip Studio so it was just a matter of figuring out the right tool or button to accomplish the task. The course managed to really break down how to approach landscapes and now I no longer feel intimidated by them. Will definitely draw more in the future."},{"id":"mixed-media-monsters","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/mixed-media-monsters","source":"@site/blog/2023-07-23-mixed-media.md","title":"Mixed Media Monsters","description":"The mixed media course on 21 Draw launched a little over a month ago now.

I\u2019ve never done any serious watercolour practice before so I was excited at the possibility of learning a new medium.\\n\\n## Inspiration\\n\\nThe first assignment of the course was 2 questions. I find these things rather cheesy and would usually skip them, but as I said in my previous blog post, doing these courses is my attempt to slow down and do the work.\\n\\n**Question 1: What gets you excited/happy? What can you talk about for hours? (5 sentences)**\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\nThis is a kind of ironic one because I recently told my girlfriend \u201cI don\u2019t feel joy\u201d and I kind of mean it but in a way that I just don\u2019t get super excited about things. I can feel joy or happiness in the moment, I look forward to things in the future, but I rarely feel really *excited* about it.\\n\\nThe biggest one is probably playing D&D. It\u2019s a solid combo of creativity, fast thinking and social time. It\u2019s probably also one of the few things I could talk about for hours.\\n\\nI have a lot of practice talking about myself thanks to over 100 hours of therapy but I can\u2019t say that that\u2019s a topic that I\u2019m excited about. I also get very excited to eat take-out but couldn\u2019t talk about that for hours unless we\u2019re looking for recommendations.\\n\\nIt\u2019s funny because I do love to read, watch tv, play video games, and just consume media in general but I don\u2019t go out of my way to talk about it for more than a few minutes. I\u2019ve always been a big Solo Enjoyer.\\n\\n**Question 2: What do you do to get inspired? (5 things)**\\n* Read blogs / adventures written by other DMs (D&D)\\n* Stare out the window (in hopes of seeing animals)\\n* Listen to podcasts\\n* Look at my previous projects\\n* Talk about ideas with other people\\n\\n**Question 3: 3 artists that inspire your work**\\nI quickly knew this wasn\u2019t a question I was prepared to answer. Which made me wonder if maybe it\u2019s a reason why I feel all over the place with style. I don\u2019t have any artists I follow really closely or ones I\u2019ve done a deep dive on their methods. But I do have a Twitter list with 100 artists whose art I like. I can\u2019t say they all inspire my art. So it took a long time to find some answers to this:\\n\\n1. [Fran Dare](https://twitter.com/frandaredoodles)\\n\\nFran used to run #drowgust over on Twitter every year, it was one of the first art month challenges that I managed to complete. They draw an endless amount of drow (and so was I a few years ago) and I really loved their greyscale approach to traditional pieces. They are probably a big reason why I own so many grey markers.\\n\\n2. [Drawfee team](https://www.youtube.com/@Drawfee)\\n\\nDrawfee is a show that\u2019s been around online for ages but I only started watching it last year. They are digital art focused, which is often how I work. They mostly draw characters or silly scenes, which is basically where I want to get comfortable with my drawings. But since they do speedraws every now and then you can watch their process, hear about how they troubleshoot an image and see them push their own artistic boundaries. Watching their episodes every week is definitely one of the big reasons why I made this year an art focused year.\\n\\n3. ???\\n\\nHonestly couldn\u2019t come up with anyone else. Back in the days of DeviantArt and blogs it was much easier to follow artists and learn about their process. I\u2019m not a huge fan of historical artists so I\u2019m not off reading about the progression of the Old Masters. A decent take away from this question is that I probably want to find some time to do research on artists, see who has good YouTube content, see if anyone is blogging about their work. Learn more about other people\'s approaches to find new directions to take my own practice.\\n\\n## Inspiration and reference material\\n\\nLike most of the courses this one tasks you with creating a moodboard and even a playlist. Since the mood boards were focused on one for real animals and one for monsters I spent some time building these up with images I like. I didn\u2019t bother to make a playlist as I find this very time consuming and not super helpful to my own process.\\n\\nIt was around this point that I realised how many different assignments there were going to be in this course. There was a blob challenge, which I did. But she says don\u2019t even bother to do this unless you know you are then going to work on a larger piece after. And in my case, I almost never have that much time on my hands to spend 20 minutes doing a blob challenge. Followed by a requested **five** pages of sketches to get ideas down. Then on top of that, choosing 3-5 and giving those characters a story related phrase to say.\\n\\nI understand that this is a course very closely following a particular artist\'s approach to their work but at this point the course was losing focus for me. Wasn\u2019t jiving with the process. I wanted to get to the technical takeaways. I know this comes a lot from my own impatience, but it\u2019s also clear that these are approaches for people who can spend 2-5 hours doing creative projects. I don\u2019t have that kind of time so I need to find my own approach.\\n\\n## Warm-up\\n\\nI did the blob challenge twice. The first time when I had limited time and the second time on a rare quiet morning. I still really do enjoy this challenge, even though I often feel head empty when I first see the shapes. I\'m usually pretty pleased with one of them by the end of it.\\n\\n![Draw a creature in the blog exercise](/img/21-draw-img/Blob-exercise.jpg)\\n\\nThen I went to my Pinterest boards and started sketching. At first I would take one idea from each monster while scrolling. Other times I would attempt to reacted a whole creature if it felt like a good challenge. Then I stared to take single pieces and try to build up something larger just using my own ideas. Then I just drew some jellyfish.\\n\\n![Some of my practice sketches](/img/21-draw-img/mm-sketches.jpg)\\n\\nI chose the moth guy to be the piece of this course. Simple enough that I felt confident I could recreate it in a new sketch. But before that I had to drop 150$ on watercolour supplies. Just had too.\\n\\nI had tried using the Aquarelle Watercolour Pencils I already owned but found I still struggled with understanding the right way to use these. I probably could have looked up some tutorials online but other then a new sketchbook I hadn\'t bought any new art materials since started these classes 6 months ago. Felt like a reasonable time to put some money into the hobby, especially if it was going to help motivate me in a course.\\n\\n## Final project\\n\\nMoth guy, who I started to call Mothmon because I felt he had Digimon design energy, got researched and then painted. Snapped a photo and then brought the painting into Procreate.\\n\\n<img src={MothmonP} width=\\"400\\"/>\\n\\nIt\'s here that Eva\'s mix media technique really starts to shine. She\'s all about doing small adjustments and touch ups or additions that blend in with the existing piece. With the goal of making everything look like it could still be a traditional art piece. And choosing when to push past that line with some stronger digital techniques.\\n\\nThis is a very slow process, and I worked very zoomed in on the screen to try to keep the touchups subtle. But once I zoomed out and did a before and after comparison I started to feel pretty happy about how everything was coming together.\\n\\n<img src={MothmonS} width=\\"400\\"/>\\n\\n## Post course extracurriculars\\n\\nI put a few hours into touching up Mothmon before decided to call it quits on the piece. The most time I\'ve put into a work for a while. Since I was still riding the excitement of a new art supply purchase I returned to the new watercolours the next weekend to keep practicing how to use them.\\n\\nMaybe it was because this course was still fresh in my mind, but I stumbled across an illustrator who I found wildly inspiring just after finishing the Mothmon piece. [Josephine__Draws](https://www.instagram.com/josephine__draws/?hl=en) on Instagram. They do gorgeous monochrome pieces, mostly focused on animals, bones, and shells. They work with very strong lines while mixing in watercolour elements. The kind of stuff that makes me want to pick up a pencil and draw whenever I see it.\\n\\nThey sadly don\'t have much of an online presence beyond their Instagram page so I\'m going to have to survive on their short looping videos."},{"id":"digital-illustration","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/digital-illustration","source":"@site/blog/2023-06-28-digital-illustration.md","title":"The basics of illustrations","description":"I put off a lot of the full illustration classes, to me they feel like putting together all the bits you\u2019ve learned to try to make something more comprehensive.

This course was titled \'Digital illustration for beginners\' so maybe it\'s just time that I start taking the courses marked \'Intermediate\' instead.\\n\\nI enjoyed the exercises she proposed but I don\u2019t feel like they prepared me for working on a full illustration.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## Eyes\\n\\nThis was an exercise I doubted because I\u2019ve done a lot of practice eyes since I started taking these courses. But this one did make me feel like I spotted a few things that make eyes more expressive with just a few lines. What I\'d really like to be able to do is simplify my approach to eyes as I think my big issue is I use too many eyes and then lose details.\\n\\n![Eyes practice sheet.](/img/21-draw-img/eyes-sheet.jpg)\\n\\n## Expressions\\n\\nThis program provided a classic expression sheet which was nice to use. I hadn\u2019t planned on doing all three rows because while I worked on it I realised I don\u2019t have characters other than Skil that I draw regularly. Which makes this exercise more difficult.\\n\\n![Expression sheet](/img/21-draw-img/expression-sheet.jpg)\\n\\nFor row two I just wanted to draw someone with hair buns, it\u2019s very clear I have no grasp on that face or character so it\u2019s basic while also being all over the place. For the 3rd row I decided to go with the character from one of my earlier lessons, Queza, who is rather squid-like so I didn\u2019t want to use her at first. But in the end it was nice to play around with a less human face.\\n\\n## Clothing and posing\\n\\nClothing has always been a weakness of mine, not because of folds and understanding fabric but because I don\u2019t have much creativity for designing outfits. I\u2019ll usually got with simple outfits, not too many layers. Or the classic cheat of; if I\u2019m comfortable with the figure I\u2019ve draw I\u2019ll put them in something fitting, if I\u2019m not comfortable with the proportions/figure I\u2019ll hide the body under something baggier.\\n\\nFor this homework I used an image from [Modern Wizard Apparel\'s Esty shop](https://www.etsy.com/ca/listing/1091751570/solid-array-wrap-wrap-vest-scarf-belted). I recently ordered a few pieces from there and love them, so you can take this as an endorsement.\\n\\n![Clothing practice](/img/21-draw-img/Illustration-homework-clothing.jpg)\\n\\nFor the posing homework, there was the fun suggestion have having three random curved lines and building a pose around that. I asked my girlfriend to draw three line and then had to deal with a terrifying N-like shape. I struggled with that one for a pretty long time but I\u2019m pretty happy with the dive pose I ended up on.\\n\\n![Pose practice](/img/21-draw-img/Illustration-homework-2.jpg)\\n\\n## The project\\n\\nSo one of my biggest weaknesses as a creative is that I\u2019m extremely impatient. One of the reasons I enjoy writing is because I can go really fast and feel good about having just written something down. When it comes to more physical hobbies like drawing or piano, I\u2019m too impatient to:\\n\\n1. Practice\\n2. Take my time when it\u2019s needed\\n\\nI\u2019m forcing the practice by taking all these courses. Just really trying to let myself be messy with art and try new things. Which is why I often do all the homework assignments. But for point 2, when it comes to \u201cputting something together at the end of the course\u201d I tend to just\u2026 not. This is partially because I just want to jump into something new and partially because I know it will take me hours of work to make anything I\u2019m really happy with. And these days I just don\u2019t know where I\u2019ll find hours of free time to put into a larger project.\\n\\nI did the thumbnailing part of the course, the first step of starting an illustration. Even came up with a few ideas I liked:\\n\\n![Illustration thumbnails for a Queza piece](/img/21-draw-img/queza-thumbnails.jpg)\\n\\nBut the thought of having to commit to one just didn\u2019t appeal to me. I put some time into trying to start one of them as a more serious piece, got distracted looking up fish brushes for Clip Studio, didn\u2019t know how to design the 2nd character, and then gave up. A whole illustration just feels a little out of my reach still. Partially because I didn\u2019t find that this course to provided too much in terms of foundational steps or approaches to things like backgrounds or styling. A bit of \u201cand then draw a background\u201d, which isn\u2019t where I\u2019m at yet. This is about as much progress as this piece will ever see:\\n\\n![Queza and a fish tank](/img/21-draw-img/Queza-illu.jpg)\\n\\n## The illustrations\\n\\nI gave illustration another shot when I went camping for a few days. This time I wanted to focus more on the steps and not coming up with a scene on my own so I used [this image as a reference](https://www.pinterest.ca/pin/697495061015057710). There\u2019s a fair bit of photography on these cormorant fishermen which are extremely beautiful. And it\'s a testament to how terrible the internet is these days that I can\'t verify who the exact photographer of the image I linked is. A curse I blame Pinterest for. A possible source (and some history behind the fishing practice), can be read about here: [Interview: Travel Photographer Highlights China\u2019s Traditional Cormorant Fishing](https://mymodernmet.com/peter-yan-travel-photography-china/).\\n\\nThis one felt a little promising at the start, felt like I was capturing the pose in the sketch and I liked how the background looked when I just laid down 4 different colours for the major shapes/features. That feeling didn\u2019t last too long once I got into the inking.\\n\\n![Side by side comparison](/img/21-draw-img/Fisherman-progress-shot1.png)\\n\\nIt\u2019s still hard for me to find time to focus on art fully, all I was really getting (on my vacation week!) was 20 minutes when I got into bed. I feel different about it every time I open it up, and have a running list of things I want to improve. But I\u2019m already at the point of \u201ceven if I finish this I\u2019m not going to be happy with it\u201d so I\u2019m ready to toss it.\\n\\n![Final fisherman progress shot](/img/21-draw-img/Fisherman-wip.jpg)\\n\\nI know pushing through is probably what\u2019s going to help me learn and become more comfortable with larger works but doing full colour, large digital illustrations isn\u2019t really my end goal when it comes to art so I\u2019m less invested in improving in that area right now."},{"id":"bean-approach","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/bean-approach","source":"@site/blog/2023-06-15-bean-approach.md","title":"Drawing cute creatures with beans","description":"After feeling pretty disappointed by the first creature course, I was excited after watching the introduction to \u2018Designing Fun Animal Characters\u2019 by Rodgon.

His approach made sense to me right from the start.\\n\\n1. Figure out the stand out physical features of a creature\\n2. Work from a simple base\\n3. Put those stand out features on the simple base\\n\\nAfter enjoying my tiny goat lesson from earlier in the year, I was hype to get back to drawing animals again.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## Creature features\\n\\nDid a few random animal sketches to warm up. Asking my girlfriend to name an animal, I would Google it, and then try to draw it. Resulted in some basic little guys but the animals happened to not have the easiest features to capture.\\n\\n![Some random creatures as warm ups.](/img/21-draw-img/animal-sketches1.jpg)\\n\\n## The bean approach\\n\\nAfter spending some time looking at animals and trying to figure out what makes them stand out, it was time to get to the base of our future creatures; the bean bag. Or as I took to referring to it; the beans.\\n\\nThe exercise started off pretty simple, make some bean shapes and then draw contour lines around them to understand the 3D shape of the bean bag aka future creature. This is to help add the feature after and to just have a better grasp of the space being occupied by the bean.\\n\\nI was pretty happy with my lined beans by the end of it.\\n\\n![My lined beans floating in space.](/img/21-draw-img/blank-beans.jpg)\\n\\nNext we moved on to adding the features. I tried to get as many random animal references as possible. Which resulted with me pulling cards out of this box\u2019s \u2018Biology\u2019 section to get an animal at random. Some beans turned out better than others. But even the messy ones helped me realize how I\u2019d approach that animal differently on a second go.\\n\\n![Some beans that kind of look like creatures.](/img/21-draw-img/IMG_0124.jpg)\\n\\n## Technicalities of technology\\n\\nThe rest of the course was more focused on important information you\u2019d want to know if you were to pursue digital art professionally. Rodgon went over file sizes, what they mean, when to save as certain file types and what to be aware of when designing for specific requests.\\n\\nHe spent a long time showing us his inking process in Adobe Illustrator which was rather eye opening to me. I\u2019d only ever opened the program once or twice before and had no idea how to use it. Seeing how the inking is so different from other digital art programs was pretty inspiring. Looked like a fun way to approach the task. So it\u2019s a shame I don\u2019t ever see myself forking over the money to Adobe to try it out for myself.\\n\\nOverall it was interesting to see a full piece come together that\u2019s pretty different from the other lessons I\u2019d followed so far that also included one piece going from sketches to completion. And I like how Rodgon shares super practical tips and approaches. Looking forward to drawing many bean shapes in my future.\\n\\n## A non art course interlude\\n\\nSo on top of trying to do 1-2 art courses a month, I have also signed up for a 5 week program on cephalopods. This is a weekly lecture through Atlas Obscura which I just thought would be fun. I also thought it would be helpful to learn more ocean creature facts for my Underwater D&D campaign. Which has already started to pay off.\\n\\nInstead of taking notes during the course I tried to focus on sketching some of the creatures the teacher shared. So these are my sketches from lesson one.\\n\\n![Cuttle fish, squids, and octopuses.](/img/artwork/squid-class1.jpg)"},{"id":"storytelling-illustrations","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/storytelling-illustrations","source":"@site/blog/2023-05-27-storytelling-illustrations.md","title":"Storytelling with illustrations","description":"I managed to finished a a course at the start of May before Tears of the Kingdom came out, \u2018Telling a Story Through Illustration\u2019.","date":"2023-05-27T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"May 27, 2023","tags":[{"label":"art","permalink":"/blog/tags/art"},{"label":"21draw","permalink":"/blog/tags/21-draw"}],"readingTime":3.64,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Kylie","title":"Admin","url":"https://github.com/kylies","imageURL":"https://github.com/kylies.png","key":"kylie"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"storytelling-illustrations","enableComments":true,"title":"Storytelling with illustrations","image":"/img/21-draw-img/POV-1.jpg","authors":["kylie"],"tags":["art","21draw"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Drawing cute creatures with beans","permalink":"/blog/bean-approach"},"nextItem":{"title":"April Art Projects","permalink":"/blog/stylized-characters"}},"content":"I managed to finished a a course at the start of May before Tears of the Kingdom came out, [\u2018Telling a Story Through Illustration\u2019](https://www.21-draw.com/my-course/?id=46594).\\n\\nI was a little intimidated by this course because the idea of doing full illustrations still feels very challenging to me. Make a scene, draw a background, manage areas of focus and lighting. All the parts of drawing in one. Which I feel like I\u2019ll never be ready for!\\n\\nThankfully this was another Tony Bancroft course and I\u2019ve come to love his approach and his assignments. As a classically trained animator he\u2019s focused on foundational aspects which is exactly what I still want to focus on.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## Frame and composition\\n\\nThe courses started off by talking about the frame (the area in which your art piece will exist) and composition. In my High School art classes composition was what the art teacher praised me for most. I didn\u2019t really understand what it meant back then, but I now think it means I had a pretty natural grasp of the use of space. This section had the mini assignment of creating different kinds of traditional compositions using only basic shapes.\\n\\n\\n![Quarters, thirds, split, and other composition types](/img/21-draw-img/Composition-1.jpg)\\n\\n## Horizon lines and your point of view\\n\\nThe next section covered different ways to layout a scene. Horizon lines are that line in an image that\u2019s usually the split between the ground and the sky. Tony shared examples on how different horizon line placements can dramatically change what\u2019s in focus in the scene or how they can be used to shift perspective.\\n\\nIn my two practice runs I tried a very high horizon line to have more space to work with a landscape. While in the second I tried a low and angled horizon line to show the size differences between the mouse and the cat while trying to create more dynamics with a tilted line.\\n\\n![Adding details to Style A](/img/21-draw-img/Composition-2.jpg)\\n\\nThe other assignment for this section was to Push You Point of View. Which means to move away from a flat scene where everything might have equal prominence to one that creates more depth by using a different point of view. The challenge provided was to draw a young girl looking up at a bird singing in a tree.\\n\\n1. Low POV looking up at the bird\\n2. High POV from the bird angled down\\n3. Flat POV where neither is in more focus\\n\\n![Point of view practice](/img/21-draw-img/POV-1.jpg)\\n\\nI really liked this as an exercise as I rarely push for different angles in my pieces but these quick sketches very easily show that the first two images are way more interesting composition wise than the last one.\\n\\n# Depth, lines, overlap\\n\\nThe rest of the course covered a few more tricks for creating a good composition.\\n\\nDepth: Work with foreground, middle, and background\\nLines of action: Use the lines of everything in the scene to point towards your focus area\\nOverlap: Overlap objects to create more depth and a more natural look\\n\\nMy first attempt at a scene using these tips, followed by pushing it with an up angle and down angle approach:\\n\\n![Adventurers in a dungeon](/img/21-draw-img/POV-2.png)\\n\\nAnd then a new piece to try to capture all the different parts of the course. I maybe only managed to get in directional lines and different depth levels. Directional lines were my main focus as I didn\u2019t use them as much in previous home works. And I find all the final \u201cnow put it all together and draw something\u201d assignments to easily feel overwhelming, it\u2019s difficult to think of something that feels like all the rules can be used. But the pros make it all look easy to bring the pieces together so I know it\u2019s possible, but my brain doesn\u2019t think in those processes just yet.\\n\\n![Mermaid for MerMay](/img/21-draw-img/Composition-3.jpg)\\n\\n## Next course\\n\\nI complained about the creature design course last time, but forgot to share that I did do the first assignment from it: drawing the skeletal and muscular structure of a creature.\\n\\n![Deer anatomy exercise](/img/21-draw-img/Deer-anatomy.jpg)\\n\\nThis was kind of fun and I can see it being helpful for doing more serious creature design. There\u2019s lots of different animal anatomy out there to learn! But instead I\u2019m going on to the \u2018Designing Fun Animal Characters\u2019 course to instead learn the much more simplified approach to creatures."},{"id":"stylized-characters","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/stylized-characters","source":"@site/blog/2023-05-21-stylized-characters.md","title":"April Art Projects","description":"In April I went through the course \u2018How to Stylize Characters\u2019.","date":"2023-05-21T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"May 21, 2023","tags":[{"label":"art","permalink":"/blog/tags/art"},{"label":"21draw","permalink":"/blog/tags/21-draw"}],"readingTime":3.08,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Kylie","title":"Admin","url":"https://github.com/kylies","imageURL":"https://github.com/kylies.png","key":"kylie"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"stylized-characters","enableComments":true,"title":"April Art Projects","image":"/img/21-draw-img/style-a-blocks.jpg","authors":["kylie"],"tags":["art","21draw"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Storytelling with illustrations","permalink":"/blog/storytelling-illustrations"},"nextItem":{"title":"Adding character to characters","permalink":"/blog/expressive-design"}},"content":"In April I went through the course [\u2018How to Stylize Characters\u2019](https://www.21-draw.com/my-course/?id=42788).\\n\\nI wasn\u2019t sure what to expect from this course. \u201cStyle\u201d is a very nebulous thing, one that I\u2019ve been told over and over again will develop with time and mastery of the basics. The course ended up focusing more on how you can work in different styles by taking different approaches and really iterating on your ideas.\\n\\nThe teacher broke down each part of the course with very well focused assignments and practical steps. With the idea being to draw the same character to match two different use cases. He was working on developing a Frankenstein\u2019s Monster character while I made the mistake of choosing one of my own D&D characters who I\u2019ve iterated on a few times already. I say this was a mistake as choosing a fresh character would have given me more freedom to experiment instead of feeling locked in a previously established character design. But even with that mistake on my side I felt like I was able to learn a lot from the assignments.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## Start with the basics\\n\\nI went with the same use cases (aka briefs) that tee instructure went with as the two styles I\u2019d aim for:\\n* A 2D childrens cartoon vibe\\n* A 3D more grown up cartoon vibe\\n\\nStep one was to do silhouettes. This built on the silhouettes covered in the previous courses, where you want to make sure your main character features are able to stand out even when working with a pure black silhouette. For the 2D version the focus was on working with basic shapes; circles, squares, triangles, etc. Then doing some simple shaping on those. For the 3D version the approach was more freehand, blocking out shapes with fewer restrictions and more details.\\n\\n![Style A silhouettes](/img/21-draw-img/style-a-blocks.jpg)\\n\\nThis process was really challenging for me, I felt like I struggled to bring anything unique to each new form. Hell, barely felt like I could make a decent looking basic shape, they all looked so awkward! But with a bit of extra refinement in shape, I was able to settle on 3 to take to the next step.\\n\\n![Adding details to Style A](/img/21-draw-img/style-a-edits.jpg)\\n\\n## Onto Style B\\n\\nWith Style B being more free to freehand sketch I ended up falling into old patterns for this character. It was at this point that I felt like I had made a misstep in not choosing a fresh character to work with and didn\'t go much further with the exercise.\\n\\n![Style B sketches](/img/21-draw-img/style-b-drafts.jpg)\\n\\nWhile I didn\'t take either of the styles to completion, this was probably one of my favourite courses so far. The differences between approaches felt unique, the process that was shown to iterate through designs, and how to mix and match pieces you liked all just made sense when seeing them in practice.\\n\\nI can definitely see sitting down to go through this whole course again with a different character in mind.\\n\\n## On to the next one\\n\\nAfter this course I was very excited to start [\u2018Creature Design\u2019](https://www.21-draw.com/my-course/?id=2664) because I have a list of creatures I want to sketch out for my underwater D&D campaign. However, this course ended up being more like \u2018doing an illustration with a creature\u2019 and less about how to strategically approach designing your own creatures. I gave it a shot by sitting through 1 of it\u2019s 8 hours but felt like it wasn\u2019t worth my time.\\n\\nFeeling a little deflated by my first \u2018DNF\u2019 I didn\u2019t touch anything for a few weeks. I\'ve now found another course that\'s getting me excited to sit down and sketch so hoping to get back to more regular practice!"},{"id":"expressive-design","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/expressive-design","source":"@site/blog/2023-04-11-expressive-design.md","title":"Adding character to characters","description":"After a month focused more on digital art practices I decided to go with more challenging courses for April.

Not challenging on a technical level, but challenging because this has always been something I\'ve felt my own drawings have lacked; energy and expression.\\n\\nOne of the March courses touched on this a little, going into the importance of silhouette and body language. I felt like that course had a lot of practical advice that was easy to start bringing in to my sketches. So I wanted to find a course that would keep elaborating on these approaches. Ending up on one titled [\\"How to Bring You Characters to Life.\\"](https://www.21-draw.com/my-course/?id=4457&lesson_id=0)\\n\\nI wasn\'t sure what to expect from the course as I knew it would be different from the typical, here\'s how to understand anatomy that lots of art classes start with. Thankfully the instructor started by breaking down the main parts of a character that add life to an image.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## Hands and Eyes\\n\\n![Practicing different kinds of eyes](/img/21-draw-img/Eyes-emote.png)\\n\\nFirst came eyes, putting them on faces, playing around with eye brows. I think the big take away from this was just acknowledging how alive a shape can become with very simple eyes thrown on it.\\n\\n![Dreaded hands](/img/21-draw-img/hands-emote.jpg)\\n\\nLike many artists, I struggle with hands. Found a good reference sheet of hand photos to use for these sketches and I\'m actually pretty happy with most of them. Sure they aren\'t clean but they convey the shape I was aiming for in most cases. Which is more of the goal of this course in particular. Find the bare minimum to keep the message in the shapes.\\n\\n## Squash and squish\\n\\n![Squash and squish](/img/21-draw-img/Squash-squish.png)\\n\\nThis jump sequence was done to practice \'squash and squish\'. Terms that come from animation for how you manipulate bodies, faces, etc. to emphasize motion and expression. You tend to give yourself more leeway with anatomy while communicating the motion that\'s happening.\\n\\n![Facial expressions](/img/21-draw-img/expression-emote.jpg)\\n\\nSquash and squish come into play in expressions to show movement in the face to convey emotions. While I understand the simple pieces to this I struggle adapting expressions to characters as I feel like I lose what makes a character face unique. In this practice I tried to ignore that fear and just push the expressions as far as I could. Which did result in some pretty ridiculous looking faces.\\n\\n## Bringing it together\\n\\n![Gesture drawing](/img/21-draw-img/Gesture-drawing1.png)\\n\\nDid some full body gesture studies to try incorporating some of the tips that were covered. It\'s interesting to return to gesture drawing in every course while taking in the advice of new teachers each time.\\n\\nAfter all those exercises the final piece of homework was supposed to be to bring it all together in a character drawing. I started that but... made a bad choice of reference image that didn\'t offer much life.\\n\\n![Skril with a staff](/img/21-draw-img/Skril-wip-course.jpg)\\n\\nI then got hooked on wanting to work on this piece as I was actually pretty happy with parts of it and felt like I was making decent improvements every time I went back to it. But then I got stuck on hating the face and had the realization that I was no longer practicing the material covered in the course. So instead of pushing forward on the piece I closed Procreate and went to choose a new course to try again.\\n\\nStarted on a stylizing characters course a few days ago which pulls on a lot of the advice from this course so I\'m hoping that it will help cement a lot of what I picked up here while I continue trying to really figure out these foundational techniques."},{"id":"more-courses","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/more-courses","source":"@site/blog/2023-03-26-more-courses/2023-03-26.md","title":"March Lessons","description":"For March I tried out a few shorter courses, two focused on getting familiar with Procreate and one about bringing life to your poses.","date":"2023-03-26T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"March 26, 2023","tags":[{"label":"art","permalink":"/blog/tags/art"},{"label":"21draw","permalink":"/blog/tags/21-draw"}],"readingTime":2.785,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Kylie","title":"Admin","url":"https://github.com/kylies","imageURL":"https://github.com/kylies.png","key":"kylie"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"more-courses","enableComments":true,"title":"March Lessons","authors":["kylie"],"tags":["art","21draw"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Adding character to characters","permalink":"/blog/expressive-design"},"nextItem":{"title":"Fungal February","permalink":"/blog/funguary-2023"}},"content":"For March I tried out a few shorter courses, two focused on getting familiar with Procreate and one about bringing life to your poses.\\n\\nThe Procreate ones were fun, focusing on creating a single piece from start to finish while learning some of Procreates key features. These tended to focus on portraits, which aren\'t usually my own focus but they\'re a good place to start.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## From pencil to Procreate\\n\\nCourse one was made by [Feefal](https://twitter.com/feefal_), the artist who ran #funguary last month. Her program starts with pencil and paper then bringing that over to Procreate to add colours. It was nice to work with physical objects again so I enjoyed working on paper to create the original outline for this piece.\\n\\n![Sketch of octogirl](/img/21-draw-img/octo-girl-sketch.jpg \\"First sketch\\")\\n\\nI also felt like she really showed how to mimic her style by using specific brushes and colouring techniques. She definitely uses a few approaches I never do so it was cool to push myself beyond my comfort zone and kind of trust her process.\\n\\nHaving just recently kicked off a new D&D campaign I knew I wanted to try and use my drawing time to create character art for future NPCs in the game. For this exercise I chose an octopus type person inspired by the [cephalid](https://www.mtggoldfish.com/price/Streets+of+New+Capenna/Queza+Augur+of+Agonies-showcase#paper) from Magic The Gathering. The end result doesn\'t look like something I would have reached on my own, so I\'m pretty happy that it feels like something new.\\n\\n![Sketch of octogirl](/img/21-draw-img/octo-girl.png \\"Final octo girl result\\")\\n\\n## Making expressive poses\\n\\nSince I got through that course in a weekend I quickly jumped into another: Drawing Character Poses with Personality. This one was pretty different from everything I\'d taken so far. For one, Tony Bancroft is a traditional animator who started the program with paper and pencil. It feels like he\'s coming from a background of animation and storytelling more then the previous teachers who felt like they specialized in character design and illustration.\\n\\nThe tricks and theory he taught were great. Really broke down some ideas that seemed complex into very digestible tips. He didn\'t have too many assignments during the course so I only have these few messy sketches:\\n\\n![Character expression practice](/img/21-draw-img/IMG_0088.png)\\n![Character expression practice](/img/21-draw-img/IMG_0089.png)\\n\\n## Back to Procreate\\n\\nAfter that theory focused, traditional approach I went back to another short Procreate lesson, this time by Erika Wiseman. This course was very similar to the first Procreate one I did, find inspiration on Pinterest, create a character, learn some Procreate tips.\\n\\nThere were a few techniques presented that I didn\'t care for and felt like they aren\'t great for refining technical skill so I didn\'t incorporate them into my sketching for the assignments. But I was very happy to learn the quick trick for making a layer for checking your values.\\n\\nI once again made things more difficult for myself by now drawing a human. Choosing instead to take some inspiration from magical looking owl creatures. Maybe they\'ll make an appearance in a D&D campaign some day.\\n\\n![Owl?](/img/21-draw-img/owl-woods.jpeg)\\n\\nAfter slow progress in February it was nice to be able to check off 3 courses in one month. Next month I\'ll try to focus on more character design courses, but we\'ll see if I stick to it or get distracted by some of the new courses that 21 Draw has been teasing."},{"id":"funguary-2023","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/funguary-2023","source":"@site/blog/2023-03-03.md","title":"Fungal February","description":"February was #funguary over on Twitter.

Those often meant drawing something new every day. For this challenge, I followed the suggested format of doing one a week to keep things more manageable.\\n\\nIn an attempt to make the process smoother for myself I spent time on Pinterest collecting images of all the suggested mushrooms for each week. With this reference collection I spent the first few days of the month sketching the mushrooms. I was hoping to do this for every week but it ended up taking more time then I expected.\\n\\n![Photo of my sketchbook](/img/artwork/mushroom-sketches.jpeg \\"Photo of my sketchbook, a page of mushrooms.\\")\\n\\nI also spent time doing thumbnails for a few of the weeks. I wanted to use that as a chance to push past my first idea and try out different compositions or concepts. But just like sketching mushroom, this took up a fair bit of my limited drawing time so towards the end I started to skip this step.\\n\\n![Simple thumbnails](/img/artwork/funguary-thumbnails.jpg \\"Some quick thumbnails for brainstorming.\\")\\n\\nThere were a lot of fun mushrooms discovered during this month so I was a little sad to only choose 4 to focus on. I did end up trying to fit in a few of the other ones in to a few of the projects. These are my 4 final pieces:\\n\\n![My 4 Funguary pieces](/img/artwork/all-fungals-2023.png \\"My four fungal friends.\\")\\n\\nI resisted doing any cute lady mushrooms as that was my first instinct. But it felt too easy to just turn all the mushrooms into dresses. I\'m not super happy with any of the pieces but there are parts that I like about all of them. I feel like #3 is decently creepy, I like how the shading came out on the body of #4 and I\'m shocked I tried to do a scene in #2. I regret not tracking how much time was put into each one as I know I kicked out the last one in one day while the first one took at least 3.\\n\\nOver the course of the month I did feel like I was improving and becoming more comfortable with Clip Studio Paint as time went on. It was nice to remember a few tricks to using the software too, proof that I hadn\'t forgotten everything I learned a few years ago.\\n\\nI don\'t think I\'ll do another challenge like this for a few months as it ate away at my actual art lesson time. But it was very nice to take a break from figure drawing humans all the time."},{"id":"getting-started","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/getting-started","source":"@site/blog/2023-02-12.md","title":"Getting started with 21Draw","description":"Towards the end of 2022 I had already started thinking of 2023 as a year I wanted to make more of an effort to get back into drawing.

I\'d never heard of the website before and was surprised to see that it was possibly the perfect fit for my 2023 goals. Online art lessons focused on core skills and even digital tools I was already familiar with.\\n\\nI don\'t usually like buying something as soon as I see it but I got sucked in by the countdown clock at the top of the page promoting an End of Year Discount. 2 subscriptions for 1/3rd the price of a normal signal subscription. And I only had 5 hours left to take advantage!\\n\\nSo anyway, 30 minutes after finding the site I was registered and ready to go with a whole year of access.\\n\\nWhile I was very excited to get to the courses focused on character design, Clip Studio, and Procreate, I forced myself to choose a beginner course as my first lesson. Then after the first lesson to stick to some core lessons like anatomy and perspective. So basically figure drawing all the time.\\n\\n![Screenshot of the course page](/img/21-draw-img/figure-drawing-class.png \\"Figure drawing class\\")\\n\\nI\'m now entering month two and I\'m finding my time to devote to course material fading.
