But after some VN research it was decided that the more efficient but more programmatically demanding way to do expressions was by working with multiple assets at once. So instead of a fully drawn happy face asset, a happy face was made out of: a smile + neutral eyes. While an angry face would be made out of: a frown + squinting eyes + angled brows. And then an embarrassed face could be: a frown + blush. Basically letting us remix different eye + mouth assets to create a lot more expressions than having to draw an individual face for each expression.
