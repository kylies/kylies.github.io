This became another thing to come up in therapy and the main suggestion I got was \u201ceven if you don\u2019t feel like doing X will be relaxing, try doing X for 10 minutes\u201d. The idea behind it was to give a hobby an honest try for a very small time commitment. If it wasn\u2019t working I could move on to something else pretty quickly.
