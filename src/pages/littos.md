In January 2025, my wife and I participated in the Sealed With A Kiss (SWAK) game jam to make a visual novel.

A spellpunk narrative game about pandemic, wizards, and first love. Solve interconnected magical mysteries and fall in love as Lauren, a conjuration junior at Crowstone University who is bored and alone in the early weeks of lockdown.

The first 2 days of the story are available to play for free on our [Itch.io page](https://sophiefromhowls.itch.io/love-in-the-time-of-spellphage-01).

You can also read my blog posts about working on all the art assets for the game: [Devlog1](/blog/2025-01-08-swak1.md), [Devlog2](/blog/2025-01-14-swak2.md), [Devlog3](/blog/2025-01-21-swak3.md). And find more of my wife's featured music [on her portfolio](https://wtchcrft.com/).
